At this stage, the DITA structure provides a language-independent functional framework, which helps
authors identify what information should be included. It is, however, still unclear how to write and
translate each element. In order to instantiate the elements as texts, we defined context-dependent CL
rules, i.e., desired linguistic patterns, for each element on both source and target sides.
For example, Event condition requires a conditional clause such as ‘日本に来たとき/nihon ni kita

toki’ (when you arrive in Japan). We also assigned a rather strict pattern for Steps element, polite speech
style with declarative form ‘します/shimasu’ in Japanese and imperative form ‘do’ in English, such as
‘以下の書類を持参します/ika no shorui o jizan shimasu’ (Bring the following documents), while the
constraint is relaxed in Context, Result and Postreq.
The problem here is that a CL-compliant ST segment does not always generate a desired linguistic

form in the target language. To resolve such incompatibilities, we introduce background pre-translation
processing to transform the ST into an internal form amenable to the chosen MT system. Figure 1 depicts
an example flow of this process for the Steps element: ST1 is the CL-compliant original sentence, in
polite speech style with the declarative ‘shimasu’. Since the MT output MT1 is not a desirable result,
ST1 is transformed internally into ST2, with the imperative ‘shiro’. This then enables MT to produce

MT2, which complies with the target side CL rule, with the use of the imperative form ‘do’. ST1 is
served to Japanese readers and MT2 to English readers. This process can be fully automated by defining
simple transformation rules based on the morphological analysis of ST,3 on condition that the linguistic
patterns of the ST are sufficiently controlled in conjunction with functional elements.
