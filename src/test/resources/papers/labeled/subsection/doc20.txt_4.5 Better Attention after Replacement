It is also interesting to check how replacement affect the
translation process in detail. Figure 4 shows the translations
for the same sentence by different systems. The figure on the
left corresponds to the baseline model without replacement.
Because the third word ’�’ (call) in the source sentence is
outside the vocabulary, the baseline model cannot generate
proper translation for it. What’s more, wrong attention to
this rare word results in bad translation for the common word

’é˝’ (America). The baseline model add an extra word
’north’ before ’america’, which is not a translation of any
word in the source sentence. And the last source word ’˘
›’(dialogue) is hardly attended by any target word, leading
to missing translation for this word, although it is also a com-
mon word. On the contrary, our system find a similar word
’|�’ to the source rare word, which is in fact a synonym
to it. Given this complete sentence without any rare word,
our system is able to generate a nearly perfect translation for
the source sentence, in which all source words are properly
attended and translated. Since the rare word ’�’ is not seen
in the bilingual training corpus, the lexical translation table
does not contain the translation for this word. So we keep
the translation of the alternative word in the output. Last, the
approach of [Luong et al., 2015b] generated a similar trans-
lation as the baseline system (not shown in the figure). And
even if a target unk is generated and aligned correctly to the
source rare word, the translation of the rare word still cannot
be restored because it’s not in the lexical translation table.
