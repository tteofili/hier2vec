Two corpora are involved within the DS task: an
out-of-domain corpus G and an in-domain corpus
I . DS selects only a portion of the out-of-domain
corpus, and leverages that subset together with
the in-domain data to train a, hopefully improved,
SMT system. As out-of-domain corpus, we used
the Europarl corpus (Koehn, 2005). As in-domain
data, we used the EMEA corpus (Tiedemann,
2009). The Medical-Test and Medical-Mert cor-
pora are partitions established in the 2014 Work-
shop on SMT1 (Bojar et al., 2014). We focused
on the English-French (En-Fr), French-English
(Fr-En), German-English (De-En) and English-
German (En-De) language pairs. The main figures
of the corpora used are shown in Table 1.
