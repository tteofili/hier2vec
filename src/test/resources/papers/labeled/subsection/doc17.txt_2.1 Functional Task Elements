DITA is an XML architecture for authoring and publishing technical information which supports struc-
tured authoring to help writers compose a modularised chunk of information, called topic (Bellamy et al.,
2012). A topic has a hierarchical structure of functional elements, i.e., elements which play certain com-
municative roles within the documents, and, at the highest level, is composed of the common elements:
Title, Short description, Prologue, Body and Related-links.
According to topic types, DITA further defines more specific elements under the Body element. DITA

provides by default several topic types such as Concept topic, Reference topic and Task topic. We focus
here on the Task topic, which is designed for describing technical procedures, because what we are
concerned is mainly municipal procedures. The left column in Table 1 shows the functional elements
under the Body of Task topic (OASIS, 2010).
Note that the functional elements of the Task topic as defined in DITA are still too coarse-grained to

properly organise municipal procedures and specify detailed linguistic patterns for each element. How-
ever, DITA allows for ‘specialisation’, so we undertook a genre analysis of actual municipal documents
and assigned fine-grained sub-elements (the right column of Table 1).
