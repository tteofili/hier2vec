As mentioned in Section 1, one well-established
DS method consists in scoring the sentences in the
out-of-domain corpus by their perplexity. Moore
and Lewis (2010) used cross-entropy rather than
perplexity, even though they are both monotoni-
cally related. For selecting S, this technique re-
lates the cross-entropy given by a language model
trained over the I together with the out-of-domain
(G) language model, computing a score for a sen-
tence x:

c(x) = HI(x)âˆ’HG(x) (1)

where HI and HG are the in-domain and out-of-
domain cross-entropy of sentence x, respectively.
