Given a source sentence x and model parameters
〈θ1, θ2〉, decoding can be formalized as follows:

ŷ = argmax
y

p(y | x; θ1)× p(yr | x; θ2)

As pointed out by (Liu et al., 2016), it is NP-hard
to perform an exact search, and so we adapt one of
their approximate search methods for the machine
translation scenario. The basic idea consists of two
steps: 1) run beam search for forward and reverse
models independently to obtain two k-best lists; 2)
re-score the union of two k-best lists using the joint
model to find the best candidate. We refer to the
reader to (Liu et al., 2016) for further details.
