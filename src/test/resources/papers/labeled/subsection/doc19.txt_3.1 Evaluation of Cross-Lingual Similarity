The cross-lingual similarity between two depen-
dency structures can be automatically evaluated.
Dependency parsing is conducted on sentences, so
we take bilingual sentence pairs as the objects for
evaluation. The calculation of cross-lingual similar-
ity needs the lexical alignment information between
two languages, which can be obtained by manual an-
notation or unsupervised algorithms.

Given a bilingual sentence pair xα and xβ , their
dependency structures yα and yβ , and the word

alignment probabilities A, the cross-lingual similar-
ity can be calculated as below:

d(yα, yβ) =

∑
(i,j)∈yα

∑
(i′,j′)∈yβ Ai,i′Aj,j′∑

(i,j)∈yα
∑

i′,j′∈xβ Ai,i′Aj,j′

The bracketed word pair indicates a dependency
edge. The evaluation metric is a real number be-
tween 0 and 1, indicating the degree of cross-
lingual consistency between two dependency struc-
tures. For the cross-lingual similarity between bilin-
gual paragraphs, we simply define it as the average
over the similarity between each sentence pairs.
