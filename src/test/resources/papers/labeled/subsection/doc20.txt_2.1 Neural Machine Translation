Figure 1: Impact of missing translations and increased ambi-
guity
red line: performances (BLEU) of sentence groups with dif-
ferent number of rare words
blue line: performances after setting different number of
words to unk in translations of the sentence group without
rare words

train a NMT model on a large corpus with a vocabulary size
of 30k to 80k, training with the whole target vocabulary is ob-
viously infeasible. So addressing the problem for rare words
is quite necessary for neural machine translation.
