Translation equivalence of the bilingual embeddings

is evaluated by naive word alignment to match word

embeddings by cosine distance.5 The Alignment Er-

ror Rates (AER) reported in Table 3 suggest that

bilingual training using Equation 5 produces embed-

dings with better translation equivalence compared

to those produced by monolingual training.
