It is well known that parameter initialization has a big im-
pact on the performance of neural networks. In this paper,
we tried two ways to initialize the parameters of the sys-
tem on replaced data. One is randomized initialization, the
other is initializing with the parameter learned by the base-
line model. According to our experience, the latter is robust
and performs better than the former for our method. But for
the approach proposed in [Luong et al., 2015b], the latter ini-
tialization strategy does not bring any benefit.
