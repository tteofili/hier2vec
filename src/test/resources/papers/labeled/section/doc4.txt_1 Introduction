Joshua1 is an open-source toolkit for statistical machine translation of human lan-
guages. The Joshua 6 release introduces a phrase-based decoder that uses the stan-
dard priority-queue-based decoding algorithm (Koehn et al., 2003) to construct a hy-
pergraphwhose format is sharedwith the existingCKY+-based hierarchical decoding
algorithms. This release also introduces a number of speed, memory, documentation,
and infrastructure improvements designed tomaximize usability in both research and
production environments. This paper highlights these improvements and provides a

examples and usage notes for both the decoder and the Joshua pipeline, which takes
care of all the steps of building and testing machine translation systems.

The original version of Joshua (Li et al., 2009) was a port from Python of the Hiero
hierarchical machine translation system introduced by Chiang (2007). It was later
extended (Li et al., 2010) to support grammars with rich syntactic labels, particu-
larly “syntax-augmented” models (Zollmann and Venugopal, 2006) . Subsequent
versions produced Thrax, the extensible Hadoop-based grammar extraction tool for
synchronous context-free grammars (Weese et al., 2011), later extended to support
pivoting-based paraphrase extraction (Ganitkevitch et al., 2012). Joshua 5 (Post et al.,
2013) introduced a sparse feature representation, support for GHKM (Galley et al.,
2004, 2006) model construction, and large-scale discriminative tuners, as well as a
number of significant improvements to speed and memory requirements.
