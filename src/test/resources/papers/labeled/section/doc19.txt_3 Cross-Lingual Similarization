Since structural analysis can be factorized into fun-
damental classification decisions, we assume that
the adjustment of the analysis results can be fac-
torized into the adjustment of the fundamental de-
cisions. The classification decision for graph-based
dependency parsing is to classify the dependency re-
lationship between each pair of words, and we hope
it works well to conduct cross-lingual similariza-
tion on the level of dependency relationship classifi-
cation. In this work, we investigate the automatic
cross-lingual similarization for dependency gram-
mars on the level of fundamental classification de-
cisions, to avoid the difficulty of using hand-crafted
transformation rules or templates.

In this section, we first introduce the evalua-
tion metric for cross-lingual similarity, then describe
the automatic cross-lingual similarization algorithm,
and finally give a method to measure the real perfor-
mance of the cross-lingually similarized grammars.
