Due to the inherent syntactic regularity of each
language and the discrepancy between annotation
guidelines of linguists, there is not necessarily struc-
tural isomorphism between grammars of different
languages. For many cross-lingual scenarios such
as information retrieval and machine translation, re-
lationships between linguistic units are expected to
be (at least roughly) consistent across languages
(Hwa et al., 2002; Smith and Eisner, 2009). For
cross-lingual applications, syntactic structures with
high cross-lingual similarity facilitates knowledge
extraction, feature representation and classification

decision. The structural isomorphism between lan-
guages, therefore, is an important aspect for the per-
formance of cross-lingual applications such as ma-
chine translation.

To achieve effective cross-lingual similarization
for two grammars in different languages, an ad-
equate algorithm should both improve the cross-
lingual similarity between two grammars and main-
tain the non-triviality of each grammar, where non-
triviality indicates that the resulted grammars should
not give flat or single-branched outputs. Differ-
ent from constituency structures, dependency struc-
tures are lexicalized without specialized hierarchical
structures. Such concise structures depict the syn-
tactic or semantic relationships between words, and
thus have advantage on many cross-lingual scenar-
ios. It is worth to perform cross-lingual similariza-
tion for dependency grammars, but the special prop-
erty of dependency grammars makes it hard to di-
rectly adopt the conventional structure transforma-
tion methods resorting to hand-crafted rules or tem-
plates.

Both graph-based models (McDonald et al.,
2005) and transition-based models (Nivre et al.,
2006) factorize dependency parsing into fundamen-
tal classification decisions, that is, the relation-
ships between words or the actions applied to cur-
rent states. We assume that cross-lingual simi-
larization can also be factorized into fundamen-
tal classification decisions, and propose an au-
tomatic cross-lingual similarization algorithm for
dependency grammars according to this assump-
tion. The algorithm conducts cross-lingual sim-
ilarization on the level of classification decisions

with simple blending operations rather than on the
level of syntactic structures with complicated hand-
crafted rules or templates, and adopts iterative cross-
lingual collaborative learning to gradually improve
the cross-lingual similarity while maintaining the
non-triviality of grammars.

We design an evaluation metric for the cross-
lingual similarity of dependency grammars, which
calculates the consistency degree of dependency re-
lationships across languages. We also propose an
effective method to measure the real performance of
the cross-lingually similarized grammars based on
the transfer learning methodology (Pan and Yang,
2010). We validate the method on the dependency
grammar induction of Chinese and English, where
significant increment of cross-lingual similarity is
achieved without losing non-triviality of the gram-
mars. As applications, the cross-lingually simi-
larized grammars gain significant performance im-
provement for the dependency tree-based machine
translation by simply replacing the parser of the
translator.
