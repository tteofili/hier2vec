Figure 1: The improvement in labeled attachment
score as a result of adding gold topological fields
to the parser by dependency length.

Since the introduction of topological fields has
very little impact on short-distance relations, the
differences in the attachment of relations that vir-
tually never cross fields (Table 2) turn out to be
negligable. However, for the relations that cross
fields frequently, we see a marked improvements
(Table 7) for every relation except the preposi-
tional object. In hindsight, this difference should
not be surprising — the relations that never cross
fields are usually very local, while those that al-
most always cross fields tend to have longer dis-
tances and/or are subject to relatively free order-
ing.

Table 8: The ten dependency relations with the
highest LAS ∆ of the parser with access to gold
topological fields compared to the (de Kok, 2015)
parser.

The ten dependency relations with the highest
overall improvement in LAS are shown in Table 8.
Many of these relations are special when it comes
to topological field structure and were not dis-
cussed in Section 2. The relations parenthesis, de-
pendent clause, and sentence link two clauses; the
sentence root marks the root of the dependency
tree; and the coordinating conjunction (clausal)
relation attaches a token that is always in its own
field.6 This confirms that the addition of topologi-
cal fields also improves the analysis of the overall
clausal structure.
