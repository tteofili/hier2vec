To evaluate the effectiveness of adding topo-
logical fields to the input, we use the publicly
available neural network parser described by De
Kok (2015). This parser uses an architecture that
is similar to that of Chen and Manning (2014).
However, it learns morphological analysis as an
embedded task of parsing. Since most inflectional
information that can be relevant for parsing Ger-
man is available in the prefix or suffix, this parser
learns morphological representations over charac-
ter embeddings of prefixes and suffixes.

We use the same parser configuration as that of
De Kok (2015), with the addition of topological
field annotations. We encode the topological fields
as one-hot vectors in the input of the parser. This
information is included for the four tokens on top
of the stack and the next three tokens on the buffer.
