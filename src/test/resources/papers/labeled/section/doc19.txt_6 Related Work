There are some work devoted to adjusting the syn-
tactic structures according to bilingual constraints to
improve constituency tree-based translation (Huang
and Knight, 2006; Ambati and Lavie, 2008; Wang
et al., 2010; Burkett and Klein, 2012; Liu et
al., 2012). These efforts concentrated on con-
stituency structures, adopted hand-crafted transfor-
mation templates or rules, and learnt the operation
sequences of structure transformation on the bilin-
gual corpora. Such methods are hard to be di-
rectly applied to dependency structures due to the
great discrepancy between constituency and depen-
dency grammars. There are also work on automati-
cally adjusting the syntactic structures for machine
translation resorting to self-training (Morishita et
al., 2015), where the parsed trees for self-training
are selected according to translation performance.
Our work focuses on the automatic cross-lingual
similarization of dependency grammars, and learnt
grammars with higher cross-lingual similarity while
maintaining the non-triviality of the grammars.

There are substantial efforts that have been made
in recent years towards harmonizing syntactic repre-
sentations across languages. This includes the Ham-
leDT project (Zeman et al., 2012; Zeman et al.,
2014), as well as the Universal Dependencies ini-
tiative (Petrov et al., 2012; McDonald et al., 2013).

Our work aims to automatically harmonize the de-
pendency representations resorting to bilingual cor-
respondence, thus can be grouped into the build-
ing strategies for harmonized or universal dependen-
cies. These existing annotated treebanks would also
permit interesting control experiments, both for the
measurement of similarity and for parsing.
