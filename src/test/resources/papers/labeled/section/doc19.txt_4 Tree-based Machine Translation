Syntax-based machine translation investigates the
hierarchical structures of natural languages, includ-
ing formal structures (Chiang, 2005), constituency
structures (Galley et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2006;
Huang et al., 2006; Mi et al., 2008) and dependency
structures (Lin, 2004; Quirk et al., 2005; Ding and
Palmer, 2005; Xiong et al., 2007; Shen et al., 2008;
Xie et al., 2011), so the performance is restricted to
the quality and suitability of the parsers. Since the
trees for training follow an annotation style not nec-
essarily isomorphic to that of the target language, it
would be not appropriate for syntax-based transla-
tion to directly use the parsers trained on the origi-
nal treebanks. The cross-lingually similarized gram-
mars, although performing poorly on a standard test-
ing set, may be well suitable for syntax-based ma-
chine translation. In this work, we use the cross-
lingually similarized dependency grammars in de-
pendency tree-to-string machine translation (Xie et
al., 2011), a state-of-the-art translation model resort-
ing to dependency trees on the source side.
