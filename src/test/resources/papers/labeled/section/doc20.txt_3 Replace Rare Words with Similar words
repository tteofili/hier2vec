Training Testing

Figure 2: Data processing diagram for training and testing

to replace rare words in training and testing data with in-
vocabulary words similar to them. The data processing di-
agram is shown in Figure 2.

In the training phase, we first learn a similarity model from
a monolingual corpus, which is used to evaluate the similarity
between words. We also need to learn word level alignment
for sentence pairs in the bilingual corpus. As a byproduct, a
lexical translation table can be derived from the aligned bilin-
gual corpus. In our experiments, we only reserve the trans-
lation with the highest probability for each word in the table.
Then the aligned word pairs which contain rare words will be
replaced with in-vocabulary words similar to them. Finally, a
NMT model will be learned from the new bilingual corpus.

In the testing phase, the rare words in testing sentence
will be first replaced with similar in-vocabulary words. Then
the sentence after replacement will be translated by the
NMTï¿½model obtained in the training phase. With the help
of the lexical translation model, the translation of those rare
words will be substituted back into the generated target sen-
tence to obtain the final result.

There are three issues not explained in detail in the dia-
gram, including i) which words in the bilingual corpus will
be replaced? ii) how to evaluate similarity between words?
iii) How to recover the translation for rare words during test-
ing? The following parts in this section will answer these
questions.
