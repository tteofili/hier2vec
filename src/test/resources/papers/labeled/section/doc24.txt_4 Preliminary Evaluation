In Spring 2015, SWoRD with instant-feedback was
deployed in 9 high-school Advanced Placement
(AP) classes. We conducted preliminary evalua-
tions to answer two research questions: (1) How
precisely does the system predict peer review solu-
tion and trigger the instant feedback? (2) How does
the instant feedback impact review revisions? We
collected peer review submissions which were inter-
vened by Instant-feedback SWoRD (i.e., triggered
instant feedback), and their immediately subsequent
resubmissions (if any), then had an expert manu-
ally code the collected comments for their feed-
back types: solution, problem-only, non-criticism
(double-coded data had inter-rater κ 0.87).

Only intervened reviews were used to evaluate
model performance because subsequent resubmis-
sions were not predicted. In our deployment, 134
of 1428 reviews were intervened, containing 891
comments: 223 Solution, 340 Problem-only, and
328 Non-criticism. Table 1 shows that our deployed
model outperforms a Bag-of-Words (BoW) base-
line6 in 3-way classification. Given that the AP data
was never used for model training, the obtained per-
formance is promising and encourages us to improve
the model with more data.

Regarding instant feedback precision, we calcu-
lated the true S-RATIO for each intervened review
(using gold standard labels). Table 2 shows that
given the 0.7 threshold used for this deployment,
Instant-feedback SWoRD incorrectly triggered in-
stant feedback for 24 submissions (column 3) out
of 134, yielding a precision 0.82. Because Instant-
feedback SWoRD does not let student reviewers
know the S-RATIO threshold, students should only
think that the instant feedback was incorrect when

they provided solutions for all mentioned problems
(true S-RATIO = 1). From this student perspective,
Instant-feedback SWoRD had 16 incorrect triggers
(column 4), achieving a precision 0.88.

Finally, to evaluate the impact of instant feedback
on review revision, we considered the 74 subsequent
resubmissions. We collected comments that were re-
vised or newly-added to the resubmissions (no com-
ment was deleted), and obtained 115 comments.
Pairing 111 revised comments with their original
versions, we observed that 73 (66%) comments
were fixed from problem-only to solution, 3 (3%)
from non-criticism to solution, only 1 comment
(0.9%) was edited from solution to non-criticism,
and none from solution to problem-only. All of
the 4 newly-added comments mentioned problems
and provided solutions. These results suggest that
Instant-feedback SWoRD does indeed help review-
ers revise their comments to include more solutions.
