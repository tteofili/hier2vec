best configuration of classifiers with supervision.
Both systems also outperform the top CoNLL sys-
tem, by 1 and 6 points, respectively. The result of
43.11 by the best classifier configuration substan-
tially outperforms the existing state-of-the-art: a
combination of two MT systems and two classi-
fier systems, and MT with re-ranking (Susanto et
al., 2014; Mizumoto and Matsumoto, 2016).
