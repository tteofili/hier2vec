We argue that trust is crucial for effective human
interaction with machine learning based NLP sys-
tems, and that explaining individual predictions is
important in assessing trust. We present a demonstra-
tion for LIME, a modular and extensible approach
to faithfully explain the predictions of any model in

an interpretable manner, and SP-LIME, a method to
select representative and non-redundant explanations,
providing a global view of the model to users. The
user interactions on multiple applications and clas-
sifiers span a variety of trust-related tasks: getting
insights into predictions, deciding between models,
and improving untrustworthy models.
