For improved machine translatability, a wide variety of controlled language (CL) rule sets have been
proposed (Kittredge, 2003; Kuhn, 2014). Evidence of reduced post-editing costs when a CL is employed
is provided (Bernth and Gdaniec, 2001; O’Brien and Roturier, 2007), and several controlled authoring
support tools, such as Acrolinx1 and MAXIT2, have been developed. The fundamental limitation of the
CLs proposed hitherto is, however, that they are defined at the level of the sentence rather than at the
level of the document (Hartley and Paris, 2001). In fact, the notion of functional document element (see
Section 2.1) does figure in some CL rule sets. ASD Simplified Technical English (ASD, 2013), for ex-
ample, specifies writing patterns linked to functional roles of the document elements; the recommended
maximum length of sentence is 20 words for ‘procedural’ writing and 25 words for ‘descriptive’ writing.
Yet, the granularity of the elements is not high enough to enable detailed definitions of linguistic pat-
terns within the elements. Thus it is necessary to formalise a document-level framework which enables
context-dependent CL specification.
In this paper, we introduce an integrated web-based system, MuTUAL, which implements a suite of

controlled authoring support modules, combined with our statistical machine translation (SMT) system.
At the document level, document structuring modules help authors create well-organised documents.
At the sentence level, controlled writing modules help them write source texts (ST) consistent with
source-language CL rules. The principal innovation in the system is to contextualise the CL rules in
the document structure to enable MT to generate outputs consistent with the target-side CL for a given
functional element. While the current system supports the creation of municipal procedural documents
in Japanese and their translation into English, it is extensible to other language pairs and text domains.
