A recent surge in GEC research has produced
two leading state-of-the-art approaches – machine
learning classification and machine translation.
Based on the analysis of the methods and an er-
ror analysis on the outputs of state-of-the-art sys-
tems that adopt these approaches, we explained
the differences and the key advantages of each.
With respect to error phenomena, we showed that
while MT is better at handling complex mistakes,
classifiers are better at correcting mistakes that re-
quire abstracting beyond lexical context. We fur-
ther showed that the key strengths of the classifi-
cation framework are its flexibility and the ability
to train without supervision.

We built several systems that draw on the
strengths of each approach individually and in
a pipeline. The best classifier system and the
pipelines outperform reported best results on the
task, often by a large margin.

The purpose of this work is to gain a better
understanding of the advantages offered by each
learning method in order to make further progress
on the GEC task. We showed that the values pro-
vided by each method can be exploited within each
approach and in combination, depending on the re-
sources available, such as annotated learner data
(MT), and additional linguistic resources (clas-
sifiers). As a result, we built robust systems
and showed substantial improvement over existing
state-of-the-art.

For future work, we intend to study the problem
in the context of other languages. However, it is
important to realize that the problem is far from
being solved even in English, and the current work
makes very significant progress on it.
