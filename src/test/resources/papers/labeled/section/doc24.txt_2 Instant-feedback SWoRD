SWoRD2 was developed to support web-based re-
ciprocal peer review, especially in large classes in-
volving writing in the disciplines where writing and
revision are hard to support due to lack of resources.
A typical peer review exercise in SWoRD involves
three main phases: (1) student authors submit pa-
pers to SWoRD, (2) student reviewers download pa-
pers assigned to them and submit peer reviews of
the papers, and (3) student authors submit paper re-
visions that address the peer reviews they received.
To further enhance the utility of SWoRD, we have

developed Instant-feedback SWoRD, with the goal
of helping student reviewers increase the presence
of solutions in the peer review comments produced
during Phase 2 of the typical peer review exercise.

Figures 2 and 1 illustrate technical details
of Instant-feedback SWoRD. As in the original
SWoRD, student reviewers create a new review ses-
sion by opening the review interface (Figure 2,
left). Now, however, whenever the SUBMIT button
is clicked, the “text review input” is passed to the
“Submission order check” (Figure 1, diamond #1).
The submission order threshold3 specifies how many
times a review will be processed for instant feedback
(e.g., 0 means no instant feedback, 1 means only
the original comments are analyzed, 2 means revised
comments are also analyzed, etc.). If the threshold
is not reached, each comment in the review is an-
alyzed by the “Comment-level Solution Prediction
Component” (see Section 3) and classified as a Solu-
tion, Problem-only, or Non-criticism. Problem-only
comments point out problems without providing so-
lutions, while Non-criticisms such as summaries or
praise do not require solutions. To measure how
many problem comments have solutions, we define
S-RATIO as number of solution comments over the
sum of solution and problem-only comments. If the
predicted S-RATIO is less than or equal to a thresh-
old4 (Figure 1, diamond #2), instant feedback is trig-

gered to scaffold students in revising problem-only
comments. Otherwise the review is deemed accept-
able and stored for later use by Phase 3.

When instant feedback is triggered, the instant
feedback interface (Figure 2, right) displays a mes-
sage at the top suggesting that comments may need
to be revised to include solutions, followed by but-
tons representing the 3 possible reviewer responses:
revise the review and resubmit (left), view some pre-
defined example comments with solutions before re-
sponding (center), or submit the review without revi-
sion (right). To call the reviewer’s attention to com-
ments that might need revision, the interface turns
text boxes around predicted problem-only comments
to red (Figure 2, middle right). For these comments,
the system also generates option buttons that ask re-
viewers to provide feedback on the prediction. We
hypothesized that asking students to reason about
the absence of solutions in their own comments
would promote review revision. Their feedback on
the system’s predictions also provides new anno-
tated examples for future re-training of the predic-
tion model (described in Section 3). Conversely, the
interface highlights predicted solution comments in
green (Figure 2, bottom right) along with displaying
a thumbs-up icon. This highlighting was designed
to draw reviewer attention to examples of solutions
in their own comments. Finally, for reviews that are
revised and resubmitted, Instant-feedback SWoRD
increases the submission order and re-checks the
threshold (diamond #1 in Figure 1). Unrevised re-
views are instead stored for Phase 3 of SWoRD.
