MuTUAL starts from the observation that the same source sentence should be translated as different tar-
get sentences depending on its location within the functional elements of the document. Let us consider
this example Japanese sentence from a procedural technical manual: ‘文書を印刷する/bunsho o insatsu
suru’. This sentence can appear as a task title in a section heading or as a step description in an itemi-
sation, and should be translated, respectively, as ‘To print a document’ or ‘Print the document’. That is,
the translation depends on the item’s functional role within the document.

Table 1: Instantiation of the DITA Task topic

To realise contextual translation using MT, we (1) formulated a document structure for municipal
procedures based on the Darwin Information Typing Architecture (DITA) framework (OASIS, 2010), and
(2) defined context-dependent CL rules in both source and target languages according to the functional
document elements, in combination with ST transformation rules.
