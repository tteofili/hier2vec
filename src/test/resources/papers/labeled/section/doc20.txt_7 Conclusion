In this paper, we systematically studied how rare words im-
pact the performance of NMT systems. And we proposed
an effective approach of replacing rare words with similar
in-vocabulary words. This approach not only enables the
translation of rare words, but also reduces the ambiguity of
the whole sentence, which is quite important for parameter
estimation during training and in-vocabulary words transla-
tion during testing. Experiment results on Chinese to En-
glish translation tasks demonstrate the power of our meth-
ods. Our best replacement method outperforms the baseline
by more than 4 BLEU points, which is also much better than
the method proposed by previous work.
