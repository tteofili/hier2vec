We present experiments on two language pairs: a hierarchical Chinese–English
system, and a phrase-based Spanish–English system. The Chinese–English system
was constructed from a variety of LDC resources, totaling just over 2M sentence pairs.
The Hiero grammar was extracted with the default settings for Thrax, Joshua’s gram-
mar extraction tool. A language model was built on Gigaword. We used the OpenMT
2012 data for tuning and evaluated against the NIST 2008 test set.

The Spanish–English system was built from Europarl using the --type moses flag
to the Joshua pipeline. For tuning, we used the WMT 2012 news test set, and for
testing, the 2013 one.
