Abstract

We introduce bilingual word embeddings: se-

mantic embeddings associated across two lan-

guages in the context of neural language mod-

els. We propose a method to learn bilingual

embeddings from a large unlabeled corpus,

while utilizing MT word alignments to con-

strain translational equivalence. The new em-

beddings significantly out-perform baselines

in word semantic similarity. A single semantic

similarity feature induced with bilingual em-

beddings adds near half a BLEU point to the

results of NIST08 Chinese-English machine

translation task.
