Abstract

The paper introduces a web-based authoring support system, MuTUAL, which aims to help
writers create multilingual texts. The highlighted feature of the system is that it enables machine
translation (MT) to generate outputs appropriate to their functional context within the target doc-
ument. Our system is operational online, implementing core mechanisms for document structur-
ing and controlled writing. These include a topic template and a controlled language authoring
assistant, linked to our statistical MT system.
