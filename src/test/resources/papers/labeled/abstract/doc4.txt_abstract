Abstract
We describe the version six release of Joshua, an open-source statistical machine transla-

tion toolkit. The main difference from release five is the introduction of a simple, unlexical-
ized, phrase-based stack decoder. This phrase-based decoder shares a hypergraph format with
the syntax-based systems, permitting a tight coupling with the existing codebase of feature
functions and hypergraph tools. Joshua 6 also includes a number of large-scale discriminative
tuners and a simplified sparse feature function interface with reflection-based loading, which
allows new features to be used by writing a single function. Finally, Joshua includes a number
of simplifications and improvements focused on usability for both researchers and end-users,
including the release of language packs— precompiled models that can be run as black boxes.
