Joshua 6 is the result of a significant research, engineering, and usability effort that
we hope will be of service to the research and open-source communities. In addition
to the user-focused releases available at joshua-decoder.org,5 we encourage develop-
ers to contribute to the Github-hosted project at github.com/joshua-decoder/joshua.
Mailing lists, linked from the main Joshua page, are available for both.

Acknowledgments Joshua’s phrase-based stack decoding algorithm began as a port
of Kenneth Heafield’s ‘mtplz‘ at MT Marathon 2014 in Trento, Italy.
