Even with the single-command pipeline invocation provided with Joshua, there
are many impediments to building machine translation systems: one must select and
obtain a large enough parallel dataset for training and tuning, have access to sufficient
computing resources, and must have some familiarity with the steps of the pipeline
should problems arise. These and other factors make it difficult for end users to in-
stall their own machine translation systems, and inhibit the adoption of customized
statistical MT systems as tools in larger applications.

For this reason, the Joshua developers have released “language packs”: tuned
models for particular language pairs that can be downloaded and run in a black-
box fashion.4 Language packs include a tuned Joshua configuration file, all reference
model files (the language model and the grammar or phrase table) in their respective
compact, binarized formats, and scripts to perform source-side normalization and to-
kenization consistent with those used during training. The user is responsible for
sentence-level segmentation.
