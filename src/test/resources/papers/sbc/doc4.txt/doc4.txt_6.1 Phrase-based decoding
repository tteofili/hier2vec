Figure 2. Decoding speeds for the 3,000-sentence newstest2013, varying the pop limits.

computed runtime for decoding all sentences in our ES-EN test set in single-threaded
mode, not counting themodel load time (except formtplz, which includes it). Figure 2
plots run times as a function of the decoder pop limit. Joshua is mostly faster than
Moses 2 except at the lowest two pop limits, but Moses 3 and mtplz are then about
twice as fast again as Joshua at very low pop limits, which advantage disappears as
the beam size is increased.
