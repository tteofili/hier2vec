It is difficult to recognize and quantify semantic sim-

ilarities across languages. The Fr-En phrase-pair

{‘un cas de force majeure’, ‘case of absolute neces-
sity’}, Zh-En phrase pair {‘依然故我’,‘persist in a
stubborn manner’} are similar in semantics. If co-
occurrences of exact word combinations are rare in

the training parallel text, it can be difficult for classi-

cal statistical MT methods to identify this similarity,

or produce a reasonable translation given the source

phrase.

We introduce an unsupervised neural model

to learn bilingual semantic embedding for words

across two languages. As an extension to their

monolingual counter-part (Turian et al., 2010;

Huang et al., 2012; Bengio et al., 2003), bilin-

gual embeddings capture not only semantic infor-

mation of monolingual words, but also semantic re-

lationships across different languages. This prop-

erty allows them to define semantic similarity met-

rics across phrase-pairs, making them perfect fea-

tures for machine translation.

To learn bilingual embeddings, we use a new ob-

jective function which embodies both monolingual

semantics and bilingual translation equivalence. The

latter utilizes word alignments, a natural sub-task

in the machine translation pipeline. Through large-

scale curriculum training (Bengio et al., 2009), we

obtain bilingual distributed representations which

lie in the same feature space. Embeddings of di-

rect translations overlap, and semantic relationships

across bilingual embeddings were further improved

through unsupervised learning on a large unlabeled

corpus.

Consequently, we produce for the research com-

munity a first set of Mandarin Chinese word embed-

dings with 100,000 words trained on the Chinese

Gigaword corpus. We evaluate these embedding

on Chinese word semantic similarity from SemEval-

2012 (Jin and Wu, 2012). The embeddings sig-

nificantly out-perform prior work and pruned tf-idf

base-lines. In addition, the learned embeddings

give rise to 0.11 F1 improvement in Named Entity

Recognition on the OntoNotes dataset (Hovy et al.,

2006) with a neural network model.

We apply the bilingual embeddings in an end-to-

end phrase-based MT system by computing seman-

tic similarities between phrase pairs. On NIST08

Chinese-English translation task, we obtain an im-

provement of 0.48 BLEU from a competitive base-

line (30.01 BLEU to 30.49 BLEU) with the Stanford

Phrasal MT system.
