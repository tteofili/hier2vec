Figure 1: (a) shows the probabilities estimated by exact softmax (blue bar), one-vs-each approximation (red bar)
and Bouchard’s method (green bar). (b) shows the 5-class artificial data together with the decision boundaries
found by exact softmax (blue line), one-vs-each (red line) and Bouchard’s bound (green line). (c) shows the
maximized (approximate) log likelihoods for the different approaches when applied to the data of panel (b)
(see Section 3). Notice that the blue line in (c) is the exact maximized log likelihood while the remaining lines
correspond to lower bounds.
