Abstract

Neural Machine Translation (NMT) sys-
tems, introduced only in 2013, have
achieved state of the art results in many
MT tasks. MetaMind’s submissions to
WMT ’16 seek to push the state of the art
in one such task, English→German news-
domain translation. We integrate promis-
ing recent developments in NMT, includ-
ing subword splitting and back-translation
for monolingual data augmentation, and
introduce the Y-LSTM, a novel neural
translation architecture.
