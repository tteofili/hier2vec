Abstract

This paper introduces and summarises the
findings of a new shared task at the in-
tersection of Natural Language Process-
ing and Computer Vision: the generation
of image descriptions in a target language,
given an image and/or one or more de-
scriptions in a different (source) language.
This challenge was organised along with
the Conference on Machine Translation
(WMT16), and called for system submis-
sions for two task variants: (i) a transla-
tion task, in which a source language im-
age description needs to be translated to
a target language, (optionally) with addi-
tional cues from the corresponding image,
and (ii) a description generation task, in
which a target language description needs
to be generated for an image, (optionally)
with additional cues from source language
descriptions of the same image. In this
first edition of the shared task, 16 systems
were submitted for the translation task and
seven for the image description task, from
a total of 10 teams.
