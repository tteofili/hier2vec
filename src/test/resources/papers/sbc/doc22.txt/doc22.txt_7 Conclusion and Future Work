In this paper, we proposed a new method for active
learning in machine translation that selects syntactic,
non-redundant phrases using parse trees and semi-
maximal phrases. We first performed simulation ex-
periments and obtained improvements in translation
accuracy with fewer additional words. Further man-

ual translation experiments also demonstrated that
our method allows for greater improvements in ac-
curacy and translator confidence.
However, there are still a number of avenues for

improvement. Particularly, as the proposed method
selected segments that took more time to translate
due to technical terms, the combination with meth-
ods to harvest unknown words (Daumé III and Ja-
garlamudi, 2011) or optimize the selected segments
based on the time required (Sperber et al., 2014) is
potentially useful. In addition, softer syntactic con-
straints that allow annotation of phrases with vari-
ables (Chiang, 2007) such as “one of the preceding
X” are another interesting avenue of future work.
