Efficiency results: Figure 5 shows the evalua-
tion scores of SMT systems trained using varying
amounts of collected phrases. In the left graph, we
see the proposed method based on parse trees and
phrase semi-maximality rapidly improves BLEU
score, and requires fewer additional words than the
conventional methods. Because the cost paid for
translation often is decided by the number of words,
this indicates that the proposed method has better
cost performance in these situations. The right graph
shows improvement by the amount of translation
time. These results here are different, showing the
4-gram-freq baseline slightly superior. As discussed
in Table 3, the methods based on parse trees select
more uncovered 1-grams, namely unknown words,
and specifically the proposed method selected more

Working time and confidence: We show the

total time to collect the translations of 10k source
words and average confidence level for each method
in Table 4. The total working time for the proposed
method is nearly double that of other methods, as
seen in the right graph of Figure 5. On the other
hand, the segments selected by the proposed method
were given the highest confidence level, receiving
the maximum value of 3 for about 79% of phrase
pairs, indicating that the generated parallel data is of
high quality. To some extent, this corroborates our
hypothesis that the more syntactic phrases selected
by the proposed method are easier to translate.
We can also examine the tendency of working

time for segments of different lengths in Table 5. In-
terestingly, single words consistently have a longer
average translation time than phrases of length 2-4,
likely because they tend to be technical terms that re-
quire looking up in a dictionary. We show the aver-
age confidence levels corresponding to phrase length
in Table 6. The confidence level of single words
in the proposed method is lower than in the base-
line method, likely because the baseline selected
a smaller amount of single words, and those se-

other hand, we can confirm that the confidence level
for longer phrases in the baseline method decreases
drastically, while it is stably high in our method,
confirming the effectiveness of selecting syntacti-
cally coherent phrases.
Translation accuracy by confidence level: Fi-

nally, we show the accuracy of the SMT system
trained by all the collected data in each method in
Table 7. To utilize the confidence level annota-
tion, we tested SMT systems trained by phrase pairs
with confidence levels higher than 2 or 3. From the
results, the accuracy of every method is improved
when phrases pairs with confidence level 1 were fil-
tered out. In contrast, the accuracy is conversely
degraded if we use only phrase pairs with confi-
dence level 3. The translation accuracy of 9.37%
BLEU with the base SMT system without additional
data became 10.72% after adding phrase pairs hav-
ing confidence level 2 or higher, allowing for a rela-
tively large gain of 1.35 BLEU points.
