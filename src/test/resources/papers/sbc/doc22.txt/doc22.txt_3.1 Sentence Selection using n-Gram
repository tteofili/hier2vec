Frequency

The first traditional method that we cover is a
sentence selection method. Specifically, it selects
the sentence including the most frequent uncovered
phrase with a length of up to n words in the source
language data. This method enables us to effec-
tively cover the most frequent n-gram phrases and
improve accuracy with fewer sentences than random
selection. Bloodgood and Callison-Burch (2010)
demonstrate results of a simulation showing that this
method required less than 80% of the data required
by randomly selected sentences to obtain the same
accuracy.
However, as mentioned in the introduction, the se-

lected full sentences include many phrases already
covered in the parallel data. This may cause an addi-
tional cost for words in redundant segments, a prob-
lem resolved by the phrase selection approach de-
tailed in the following section.
