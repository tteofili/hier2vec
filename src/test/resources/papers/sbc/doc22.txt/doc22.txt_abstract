Abstract

Active learning is a framework that makes it
possible to efficiently train statistical models
by selecting informative examples from a pool
of unlabeled data. Previous work has found
this framework effective for machine trans-
lation (MT), making it possible to train bet-
ter translation models with less effort, partic-
ularly when annotators translate short phrases
instead of full sentences. However, previous
methods for phrase-based active learning in
MT fail to consider whether the selected units
are coherent and easy for human translators
to translate, and also have problems with se-
lecting redundant phrases with similar con-
tent. In this paper, we tackle these problems
by proposing two new methods for selecting
more syntactically coherent and less redun-
dant segments in active learning for MT. Ex-
periments using both simulation and extensive
manual translation by professional translators
find the proposed method effective, achiev-
ing both greater gain of BLEU score for the
same number of translated words, and allow-
ing translators to be more confident in their
translations1.
