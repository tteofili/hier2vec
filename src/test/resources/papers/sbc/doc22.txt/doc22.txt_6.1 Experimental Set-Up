the proposed method. For each method we col-
lected translations of 10k source words, alternating
between segments selected by each method to pre-
vent bias.
We used the same dataset as the English-Japanese

translation task and the same tools in the simula-
tion experiment (Section 5). However, for training
target language models, we interpolated one trained
with the base data and a second trained with col-
lected data by using SRILM (Stolcke, 2002) because
the hand-made data set was too small to train a full
language model using only this data. We tuned the
interpolation coefficient such that it maximizes the
perplexity for the tuning dataset.
