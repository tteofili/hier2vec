In this section, we first provide an outline of the ac-
tive learning procedure to select phrases for SMT
data. In this paper, we regard a “phrase” as a
word sequence with arbitrary length, which indi-
cates that full sentences and single words both qual-
ify as phrases. In Algorithm 1, we show the general
procedure of incrementally selecting the next candi-
date for translation from the source language corpus,
requesting and collecting the translation in the target
language, and retraining the models.

Algorithm 1 Active learning for MT
1: Init:
2: SrcPool ← source language data including candidates for translation
3: Translated ← translated parallel data
4: Oracle ← oracle giving the correct translation for an input phrase
5: Loop Until StopCondition:
6: TM ← TrainTranslationModel(Translated)
7: NewSrc ← SelectNextPhrase(SrcPool, Translated, TM)
8: NewTrg ← GetTranslation(Oracle, NewSrc)
9: Translated ← Translated ∪ {⟨NewSrc, NewTrg⟩}
In lines 1-4, we define the datasets and initialize

them. SrcPool is a set with each sentence in source
language corpus as an element. Translated indi-
cates a set with source and target language phrase
pairs. Translated may be empty, but in most cases
will consist of a seed corpus upon which we would
like to improve. Oracle is an oracle (e.g. a human
translator), that we can query for a correct transla-
tion for an arbitrary input phrase.
In lines 5-9, we train models incrementally.

StopCondition in line 5 is an arbitrary timing when
to stop the loop, such as when we reach an accu-
racy goal or when we expend our translation bud-

get. In line 6, we train the translation model using
Translated, the available parallel data at this point.
We evaluate the accuracy after training the transla-
tion model for each step in the experiments. In line
7, we select the next candidate for translation using
features of SrcPool, Translated and TM to make
the decision.
In the following sections, we discuss existing

methods (§3), and our proposed methods (§4) to im-
plement the selection criterion in line 7.
