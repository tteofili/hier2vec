Preface

This volume contains the papers presented at DMTW-2016: Deep Machine Translation Workshop
held on October 21, 2016 in Lisbon.

Each submission was reviewed by 3 program committee members. The committee decided to
accept 6 papers. The submission and proceedings creation has been handled by the EasyChair
system.

We thank the QTLeap EU project for providing local funding for the workshop organization,
to the team of António Branoco at FCUL in Lisbon for handling local arrangements and to Rudolf
Rosa for preparing the proceedings.

Abstract

Moses is a well-known representative of the phrase-based statistical machine translation systems
family, which are known to be extremely poor in explicit linguistic knowledge, operating on flat
language representations, consisting only of tokens and phrases. Treex, on the other hand, is a
highly linguistically motivated NLP toolkit, operating on several layers of language representa-
tion, rich in linguistic annotations. Its main application is TectoMT, a hybrid machine translation
system with deep syntax transfer. We review a large number of machine translation systems that
have been built over the past years by combining Moses and Treex/TectoMT in various ways.
