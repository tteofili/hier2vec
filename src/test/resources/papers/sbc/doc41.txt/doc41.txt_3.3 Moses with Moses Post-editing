In case one does not have two different systems to combine, the simple approach of Oflazer and El-
Kahlout (2007) can always be tried, who were the first to report translation quality improvements by

8PhraseFix (Section 3.2) also allows non-isomorphic translation, but only as post-processing. All other Moses-based sys-
tems (including Chimera, Section 3.7 & Section 3.8) allow non-isomorphic translations, but their transfer is on the t-layer.

training Moses to post-edit its own output. The setup, shown in Figure 4, is generally identical to that
described in Section 3.2, except for using a standard bilingual Moses as the first-stage system, and then
again Moses, this time in a monolingual setting, as the second-stage system. This setup was implemented
and evaluated for English-to-Czech translation in (Rosa, 2013, section 7.4.1), but no improvements were
found; based on a review of previous papers reporting positive results, the authors noted that this ap-
proach is probably only useful in cases where the available parallel training corpus is very small.

A more elaborate attempt in the same direction was presented as the TwoStep setup of Bojar and Kos
(2010), this time bringing in Treex as well. TwoStep uses a first-stage Moses to translate from English
into intermediate Czech, where each word is represented by a tuple of its lemma and a label marking
several morphological features (such as detailed PoS, morphological number, grade, and negation). The
second-stage Moses then translates from intermediate Czech into Czech (see Figure 5). The conversion
of Czech into intermediate Czech is performed by a Treex pipeline described by Bojar and Žabokrtský
(2009), with the main component being the Morče tagger of Spoustová et al. (2007). Unfortunately, this
complex setup has not been found to have any benefit either.
