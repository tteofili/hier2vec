We reviewed a range of existing methods of combining the linguistically poor Moses phrase-based ma-
chine translation system with linguistically rich systems implemented in the Treex NLP framework, most
notably the TectoMT system, including their automatic evaluation via BLEU as reported in the literature.
Some of the methods have been shown to achieve significant improvements in the translation quality,
as measured by BLEU as well as by human evaluation. The most successful are the Chimera methods,
which constituted the state-of-the-art in English-to-Czech machine translation in several WMT transla-
tion shared tasks.

On the other hand, many other methods have not brought any significant improvement, or have even
lead to a deterioration of the translation quality. However, we believe these methods to be worth consid-
ering as well, as they bring more insight into the problematics of hybrid translation. Moreover, some of
them might be further modified or combined in future, and may eventually become useful, possibly for a
different language pair or for a specific domain.

Factoring Adjunction in Hierarchical Phrase-Based SMT

Abstract

While much work has been done to inform Hierarchical Phrase-Based SMT (Chiang, 2005)
models linguistically, the adjunct/argument distinction has generally not been exploited for these
models. But as Shieber (2007) points out, capturing this distinction allows to abstract over ‘in-
tervening’ adjuncts, and is thus relevant for (machine) translation in general. We contribute an
adjunction-driven approach to hierarchical phrase-based modelling that uses source-side adjuncts
to relax extraction constraints–allowing to capturing long-distance dependencies–, and to guide
translation through labelling. The labelling scheme can be reduced to two adjunct/non-adjunct
labels, and improves translation over Hiero by up to 0.6 BLEU points for English-Chinese.
