Adjunction in Tree-Adjoining Grammar allows to explain a number of linguistic phenomena like raising
or wh movement (Kroch and Joshi, 1985), but we focus here on modification, which we identify with
dependency labels (we use the Turbo parser1).

We identify modifier labels and punctuation with adjuncts: AMOD, NMOD, VMOD and P. We exclude
cases where the dependent appears obligatory, based on the head’s POS tag: DT, EX, IN, POS, MD, PRP,
PRP$, RP, SYM, TO, WDT, WP, WP$, WRB, .; we also exclude possessors in genitive constructions, by
excluding dependents preceding a dependent with a POS part of speech.

We include dependents of enumerations and conjunctions in the list of modifiers. This follows from a
dependency analysis that treats one of the conjuncts as the head, and conjunctions and other conjuncts as
its dependents. In the case of the Turbo parser, the last conjunct or element in an enumeration is regarded
as the head. We modified this representation to a nested one, where conjunctions are treated as heads of
the dependent conjunct, as shown in Figure 2.

adjuncts.
