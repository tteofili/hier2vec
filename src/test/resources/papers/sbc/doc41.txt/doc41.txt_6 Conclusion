We have presented an adjunct-driven extension to Hiero: the model uses source-side adjuncts to extract
larger phrases and to label rules. The model is able to improve over Hiero for English-Chinese with
minimal labelling and a few features. This improvement appears to be mostly lexical: the model captures
long-distance dependencies better, but not long-distance reorderings. We found no improvement for
English-Dutch and English-French. The lesser extent of reordering in these language pairs may limit the
application of rules involving adjuncts; further constraining the model may then be beneficial for these
language pairs too.

We have also presented a second extension, that factors adjunction to derive rules with simpler adjunc-
tion patterns. This extension leads to a decrease in performance compared to Hiero: while an adapted
feature and label set may help this model, constraints on which adjuncts to excise are likely to be neces-
sary as well.

Abstract

This paper presents a Hybrid Approach to Deep Machine Translation in the language direction
from English to Bulgarian. The set-up uses pre- and post-processing modules as well as two-level
transfer. The language resources that have been incorporated are: WordNets for both languages;
a valency lexicon for Bulgarian; aligned parallel corpora. The architecture comprises a pre-
dominantly statistical component (factor-based SMT in Moses) with some focused rule-based
elements. The experiments show promising results and room for further improvements within
the MT architecture.
