Similarly to the previous setup, Moses is complemented by a post-editing system implemented in Treex;
this time, the system is Depfix (see Figure 7). Depfix (MarecÌŒek et al., 2011; Rosa, 2014) consists
of several dozens rule-based post-editing Treex blocks. It focuses mainly on enforcing grammatical
correctness, e.g., marking the subject and object by inflectional endings based on analysis of the source
sentence, or inflecting adjectives to morphologically agree with their head nouns in gender, number, and
case. However, contrary to the TectoMT post-editing (Section 3.4), it only modifies the erroneous parts
of the output, thus avoiding generating too much noise; its second strength is the availability of the source
analysis to the post-editing blocks, which enables them to make better-informed decisions regarding the
intended meaning of the target sentence. This leads to a small but consistent improvement in BLEU.
