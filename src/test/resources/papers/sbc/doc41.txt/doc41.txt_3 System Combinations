This section contains description and evaluation of several system combination setups. We list a number
of combinations of Moses and Treex/TectoMT that we are aware of, both successful and unsuccessful.

Results of automatic evaluation of the setups, as reported in available literature,6 are provided in
Table 1. We report absolute differences in BLEU scores7 versus the base systems, rather than the absolute
scores themselves – the setups were evaluated on many different test sets, and it is well known that BLEU
scores are not directly comparable across datasets. Still, for each of the references in Table 1, we also
list the absolute scores of the base system(s) in Table 2. We round up the scores to one decimal digit.

6Except for “Moses + TectoMT post-editing” (Section 3.4), which we ran and evaluated ourselves.
7The scores are either case-sensitive or case-insensitive BLEU scores, depending on what was reported in the referenced

paper. We do not include information on statistical significance of the score differences, as most of the authors did not report
that. We kindly ask the interested reader to refer directly to the referenced papers or to their authors for any further details.

While most of the setups have been properly described and evaluated in a peer-reviewed publication,
others, especially some of the unsuccessful ones, were never properly published; in such cases, the
descriptions and results are based on semi-official materials provided by the authors of the experiments.
