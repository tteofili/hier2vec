We present an adjunction-driven extension to Hiero with two distinguishing features: we use adjuncts to
guide the extraction from larger phrases than normally allowed by Hiero; and we apply labelling to let
the model distinguish adjuncts from arguments and other phrases. We present the extraction constraints
in section 3.1, the labelling method in section 3.2, and the features we use for the model in section 3.3.
Additionally, section 3.4 presents another extension, inspired from (Arnoult and Simaâ€™an, 2012), that
leverages adjunct optionality to extract additional rules.
