The PhraseFix system of Galuščáková et al. (2013) is based on the work of Simard et al. (2007), who
introduced the idea of automatically post-editing a first-stage MT system by a second-stage MT system,
trained to “translate” the output of the first-stage system into a reference translation. This has been shown
to be particularly beneficial for conceptually different MT systems. In PhraseFix, the source English side
of the CzEng parallel corpus of Bojar and Žabokrtský (2009) is translated by TectoMT into Czech, and
Moses is then trained in a monolingual setting to translate the TectoMT-Czech into reference-Czech, i.e.,
the target side of CzEng (see Figure 3). Evaluation shows that this approach works well in principle,
significantly improving the quality of the output as compared to the base TectoMT system. However, it
does not surpass the translation quality provided by a standard standalone bilingual Moses.
