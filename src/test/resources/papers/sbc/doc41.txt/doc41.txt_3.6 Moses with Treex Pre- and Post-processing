Here, Treex is used in a more aggressive way, modifying the input and/or output to account for phenom-
ena that the PB-SMT system is known not to be able to handle well (see Figure 8).

Zeman (2010) used several pre-processing steps to make the source English text more similar to Czech,
such as removing articles, marking subjects by artificial suffixes (“/Sb”), and reordering auxiliary verbs
to neighbor their main verbs. Of course, the SMT system was also trained on texts preprocessed in that
way; in these experiments, the Joshua PB-SMT system (Li et al., 2009) was used instead of Moses.
This approach may seem too aggressive, prone to making the input noisier as well as being potentially
lossy. However, the author showed that with careful selection and tuning of the pre-processing steps,
a significant improvement of translation quality can be achieved; moreover, this was also confirmed on
English-to-Hindi translation.

Rosa et al. (2016) successfully apply Treex pre-processing and post-processing to Moses, but this time
with the main objective being an adaptation of Moses trained on general-domain data to a specific domain
(namely the domain of Information Technology). The authors use Treex to perform forced translation of
identified named entities, using a named entity recognizer and a bilingual gazetteer, as well as forced non-
translation of special structures (URLs, e-mail addresses, computer commands and filenames); Moses
XML annotation is used to preserve the forcedly translated items.12 Apart from domain adaptation,
simpler general Treex pre- and post-processing steps were also successfully used, such as projection of
letter case in identical words from source to target.
