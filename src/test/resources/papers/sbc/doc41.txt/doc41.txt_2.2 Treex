Treex2 (Popel and Žabokrtský, 2010; Žabokrtský, 2011) is a linguistically motivated NLP framework.
It consists of a large number of smaller components performing a specific NLP-task (blocks), both
Treex-specific as well as Treex-wrapped external tools, which can be flexibly combined into processing
pipelines. Sentences are represented by surface and deep syntactic dependency trees, richly annotated
with numerous linguistic attributes, similarly to the Prague Dependency Treebank (Hajič, 1998).
