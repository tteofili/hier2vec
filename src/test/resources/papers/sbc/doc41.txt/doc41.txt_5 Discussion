We have presented an adjunction-based hierarchical phrase-based model, that extends Hiero in two ways:
by letting adjuncts guide the extraction of larger phrase pairs, and by marking adjuncts through labelling.

Our model outperforms Hiero for English-Chinese on training sets of moderate size (500k and 2M sen-
tence pairs), by 0.5 and 0.6 BLEU points respectively. The improvement is brought by the combination
of extraction features with a minimal adjunct/non-adjunct source labelling scheme. This is a very posi-
tive result, that shows that the adjunct/argument distinction can be useful for machine translation, even

a Results are based on a single tuning round

though our means to identify adjuncts are coarse (in the example of Figure 1 for instance, “to the solar
power industry” is argueably an argument of “made the switch”, and not an adjunct). Beside we assumed
here that source adjuncts project into target adjuncts. This is an optimistic assumption (Hwa et al., 2002;
Arnoult and Sima’an, 2014), and we are bound to extract many erroneous rules. The adjunct-driven
model is however able to guide the model sufficiently well to ward off these rules for English-Chinese.
Refining the labels and features is likely to further enhance the model.

While our feature set may be improved, we face the difficulty that the current features are informative
of the extraction of a rule, and we accordingly store their values along with the rules in the grammar.
This increases the size occupied by the grammar in memory, making it harder to extract grammars for
larger training sets.

We found that the adjunct-driven model provides no improvement over Hiero for English-Dutch and
English-French. We believe that the improvement for English-Chinese is related to the extent of re-
ordering in this language pair: while system scores suggest a mostly lexical improvement, reordering in
English-Chinese may favor the application of hierarchical rules (rather than glue rules), and benefit more
from the linguistic constraint brought by the adjunct-driven model.

Additionally, we have presented another extension, that leverages adjunct optionality to extract rules
by excising adjuncts and their projections, following what Arnoult and Sima’an (2012) had done for
a phrase-based model. The resulting model underperforms Hiero for English-Chinese, and while an
adapted feature and label set may improve results, selecting which adjuncts to excise appears necessary.
