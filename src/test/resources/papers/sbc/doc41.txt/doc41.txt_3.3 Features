The model uses two rule features to distinguish larger phrase pairs from Hiero-extractable phrase pairs:
a long-distance feature, corresponding to the probability estimate that a rule was extracted from a larger
phrase pair (exceeding Hiero’s max-phrase-length); and an adjunct-crossing feature corresponding to
the probability that a rule was extracted from a (shorter) phrase pair violating the non-adjunct-crossing
constraint.

Besides, we tested a version of the model with a simplified labelling for adjunct sequences. These
sequences are then labelled with A instead of Ax, while their size x appears in the following feature:

fx = e
1−x (1)

For other rules (adjuncts and other phrase pairs), fx is taken to be 1.
