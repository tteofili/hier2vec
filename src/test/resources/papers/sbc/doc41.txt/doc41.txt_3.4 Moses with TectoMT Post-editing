This setup uses Moses with transfer-less TectoMT as a post-editing tool (see Figure 6). A transfer-less
TectoMT performs a tecto-analysis of the input, and then immediately proceeds with the tecto-synthesis

of the output, completely omitting the interlingual transfer step.
Theoretically, analysis and a subsequent synthesis of a correct sentence should lead to the output being

identical to the input (except for real synonymy). The motivation of Moses with transfer-less TectoMT
post-editing was that incorrect sentences should be fixed this way, especially with respect to grammatical
agreement. However, even the first assumption of identical output for correct sentences is not always
true in practice, as some of the Treex blocks are not 100% accurate. Unfortunately, the assumption about
fixing incorrect sentences also did not stand the practical test, mainly because the incorrect sentence on
input tends to confuse the analysis pipeline and often leads to a largely incorrect analysis being produced
(even if we disregard the fact that it is hard to define a correct analysis of an incorrect sentence).

We have been unable to find any work evaluating this particular setup, apart from the project of Majliš
(2009), who applied TectoMT post-editing to Google Translate.9 Therefore, we rerun the experiment
ourselves, using current TectoMT10 to post-edit the output of Moses obtained from the website of the
WMT 2016 translation task (Bojar et al., 2016),11 confirming the negative result reported by Majliš.
