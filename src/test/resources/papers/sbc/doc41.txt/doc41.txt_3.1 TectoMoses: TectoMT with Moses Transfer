In the TectoMoses experiment of Popel (2013), which is depicted in Figure 2, the transfer step of Tec-
toMT is substituted with Moses. This means that after the analysis to t-layer, each source-language
t-tree is linearized into a sequence of lemmas and formemes (either as two factors, or interleaved). This
linearized sequence is translated by Moses (trained on such data) into a target-language sequence of lem-
mas and formemes. Afterwards, dependencies are projected (using Moses alignment) from the source
t-tree to the target sequence to reconstruct the target t-tree. Grammatemes and other attributes are also
projected along the alignment. Finally, target-language synthesis is performed (as usual in TectoMT).

TectoMT’s main transfer is isomorphic, which means translating one t-node to one t-node and keeping
the dependency structure of the t-tree unchanged. This is much more powerful that surface word-to-
word translation because t-nodes can represent e.g. complex verb forms (“have been done” is translated
as “bylo uděláno”). However, there are still many cases which cannot be translated isomorphically on
the t-layer. One of the advantages of TectoMoses is that it allows non-isomorphic transfer on t-layer, e.g.

translating one t-node with two or more t-nodes or deleting some t-nodes.8 It also uses MERT tuning and
it should scale with more training data. In the experiments with two factors (Popel, 2013), two language
models were used: one for lemmas and one for formemes. Unfortunately, the TectoMoses experiment
brought negative results, presumably due to additional noise introduced by the added transformations.
