Results for English-Chinese, with a small training set
Table 4 presents test results on the smaller English-Chinese training set (500k sentence pairs). These
tests compare the adjunction-based models, with and without labelling or features, to a Hiero baseline.
We also tested the effect of relaxing the decoding span on Hiero. We use the following identifiers
for the models: H-100 is a Hiero model with a relaxed decoding span, adj uses adjunction-based
constraints, but no labels or adjunction features; adj-F also uses the long-distance and adjunct-crossing
features; adj-L uses labels (including adjunct-sequence labels); adj-FL uses both features and labels;
adj-L2F replaces the adjunct-sequence labels by their corresponding feature.

While extending extraction spans with the adj model decreases performance, both labelling and the
base adjunction features allow to guide decoding in the adjunct-driven models, and outperform Hiero,
both in terms of BLEU and BEER (Stanojević and Sima’an, 2014). The highest improvements are
obtained for the models employing both labelling and features, with little or no difference between the
full-label model adj-FL and the label-to-feature model adj-L2F. The lack of improvement in LR
score (Birch and Osborne, 2011) suggest that the adjunct-driven models improve lexical selection rather
than reordering.

Effect of training set size
Table 5 presents results for the larger English-Chinese data set (2M training sentence pairs). With a larger
data set, relaxing the decoding span for Hiero (H-100) is beneficial for English-Chinese–locally learned
rules are useful when applied to larger spans. As before, extending extraction spans alone decreases
performance, but labels and features allow to guide the model and improve performance; the adj-L2F
model outperforms Hiero by 0.6 BLEU point.

Tests on other language pairs
Table 6 presents results for English-French and English-Dutch for training sets of 500k sentence pairs.
We find that the adjunction-driven model performs similarly to Hiero for both these language pairs.

Inspection of output translations shows several cases of improved lexical selection for French. For
instance, the adj-L2F model is able to capture the dependency between ‘enthusiasm’ and ‘wane’ in
the first example in Table 7, and to translate both words appropriately. One also can find examples of
improved reordering, as in the second example in the table. While both Hiero and the adj-L2F model
wrongly reorder the translations of ‘geopolitical’ and ‘geographical’, making them appear as dependents
of ‘outpost’ and ‘population’ respectively, the adj-L2F model is able, unlike Hiero, to preserve the
dependency between ‘outpost’ and ‘of europe’.

Adjunct factorization model
Table 8 presents preliminary results for the adjunct factorization model of section 3.2 (adj-Opt). While
this model does not use adjunction or features, the gap in performance with regard to Hiero appears bigger
than for the adj model.
