Hiero limits phrase spans for rule extraction through a max-phrase-length constraint (of typically 10 to-
kens). This limit is needed to restrict the number of extractable phrases, that may grow exponentially
with sentence length. Further, reorderings may manifest themselves differently locally than at the sen-
tence level, so that the task of learning sentence-level rules may be better handled separately. However, as
adjunction introduces long-distance dependencies, factoring it out should allow to extract more relevant
phrase pairs.

We use adjunction as a guide to extending rule extraction for larger phrases. Like Hiero, we allow
extraction and unconstrained rewriting of all phrases under max-phrase-length. For larger phrases, we
subject extraction and rewriting to three constraints: max-effective-length, non-adjunct-crossing, and
max-target-symbols. Besides, we apply specific constraints to adjuncts and adjunct sequences.

max-effective-length
We define the effective length as the non-adjunct token count of phrase. Let a phrase φ, that contains
α0..αn adjuncts (disregarding adjuncts embedded in other adjuncts), its effective length λ(φ) is:

λ(φ) = len(φ)− Σni=0len(αi)

In practice, we set max-effective-length to the same value as max-phrase-length.
This constraint only applies to non-adjunct phrases, as we allow the extraction of all phrases that

match an adjunct on the source side, or a group of adjuncts: we group together adjuncts that have the
same orientation with regard to their head, and that form contiguous sequences on source and target
sides.

no-adjunct-crossing
This constraint prevents the extraction of larger phrases that cross adjuncts, or groups of adjuncts. This
forces rewriting to an adjunct group as a whole. When rewriting from an adjunct group, one only forbids
adjunct crossings, allowing rewriting to sub-groups.

max-target-symbols
Hiero limits the number of right-hand-side symbols on the rules’ source sides. The length of the target
side can also be limited: for Hiero, we apply max-phrase-length to the target side of extraction phrase
pairs; for the adjunction-based models, we limit the number of target right-hand-side symbols to the
same value as max-phrase-length.

Table 1 shows a possible derivation for the example of Figure 1. Allowing the extraction of rules from
larger phrases permits to capture long-range dependencies and reorderings inaccessible to Hiero. While
rule r1 is likely in fact to be learnt by Hiero in a different context, rule r2 displays a pattern (extraposed
modifier in the Dutch sentence but not in the English sentence) that is only likely to occur with a long
modifier.
