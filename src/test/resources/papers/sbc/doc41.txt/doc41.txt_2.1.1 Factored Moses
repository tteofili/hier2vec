In the more recent experiments that we report, the Moses system used is actually the Factored Moses of
Bojar et al. (2012). It translates the source English text into a factored representation of Czech, where
each word is represented by a tuple of a word form and a corresponding part-of-speech (PoS) tag. This
enables Moses to use an additional language model which operates on PoS tags instead of word forms.
This helps overcome data sparsity issues of the word-based language model and thus leads to a higher
output quality, especially to its better grammaticality. Factored Moses is trained on parallel corpora
pre-analyzed by Treex.
