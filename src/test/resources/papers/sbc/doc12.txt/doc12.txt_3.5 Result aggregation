Combining individual sentence scores to an over-
all system-level result is done in two ways. The
straightforward way is to simply take an arithmetic
mean of all sentence scores, indicated in table 4 as
unweighted or not W. This gives a total score for

corpus c containing N sentences as:

unweightedc =

∑
s scores
N

(2)

Additionally, to investigate the importance of
the aligned words in our sentence, we produce
a version which assigns each sentence a weight
equal to the proportion of nodes aligned in the sen-
tence. With na aligned nodes and nna unaligned
nodes, the weight for sentence s for the Weighted
version of DTED (W in table 4) is calculated as:

weights =
na

na + nna

For an individual sentence the score and weight
can be viewed separately, while overall values for
a corpus are calculated as:

weightedc =

∑
s(scores × weights)∑
