The standalone nature of the second phase of Me-
teor’s pipeline means that we can use it in isolation
and consider it an existing metric for word order.
We have thus modified Meteor trivially to ignore
the initial harmonic mean and produce only a frag-
mentation score; results for both this and the off-
the-shelf system are reported in section 4.

Talbot et al. (2011) use a similar technique to
Meteor-Frag, basing its results on the number of
chunks of contiguous words aligned by a human
annotator. Birch et al. (2010) provide a different
approach to the problem, representing word order
as mathematical permutations and counting indi-

vidual disagreements in order, and transformations
required to convert one sentence into another, in a
number of ways. They ignore all features of a text
other than word order of aligned nodes, to produce
a mathematically pure model, but sacrifice some
of the less vital – but still useful – information
represented by unaligned nodes and inter-word se-
mantic relationships.

Contrary to the above metrics’ focus on word
order in isolation, two tools have been designed
to provide a simple approximation of several error
categories at once. Both Addicter (Zeman et al.,
2011) and Hjerson (Popović, 2011) use compar-
isons of aligned words to provide a quick analysis
of missing, unexpected and moved nodes.
