While the above metrics all apply to n-grams or
other unstructured representations of data, a num-
ber of proposals exist of metrics which use de-
pendency parsing to represent sentence structure.
Liu and Gildea (2005) improved on the base con-
cept behind BLEU to calculate headword chain
precision for unlabelled dependency trees, while
Owczarzak et al. (2007) extend this to use labelled
dependencies.

Habash and Elkholy (2008) use a different ap-
proach to dependency trees, merging n-gram pre-
cision subscores calculated similarly to BLEU
with ‘span-extended structural bigram precision
subscores’, using two methods to compare similar-
ities between surface (flat) distances for different
pairs of adjacent nodes. Yu et al. (2014) use a dif-
ferent approach again, considering only the refer-
ence trees’ structural elements and observing, for
a variety of structural segments which they con-
sider most relevant, whether the hypothesis sen-
tences contain the same words as those segments
in the same order.
