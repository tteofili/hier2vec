While we have implemented a number of variants
of DTED, for WMT 2015 and WMT 2016 we use
only the ‘Pure’ version which processes only the
structure of the sentences while ignoring other in-
formation such as word alignments. DTED has
been run on two types of input. First, we have run
each version on normal dependency trees, leverag-
ing the full structural information available. For
comparison, we have also run each on flattened
trees from which the structural information has
been removed. This is done in a preprocessing
step by artificially forcing each node to be the only
child of its predecessor. This version is intended to
nullify the structural advantage given by the rest of
the system, to provide a baseline for comparison.

With the ‘pure’ version of DTED, the modifica-
tions shown in Table 2 are calculated.
