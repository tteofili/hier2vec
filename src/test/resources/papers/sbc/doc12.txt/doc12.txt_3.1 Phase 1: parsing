In order to best represent the structure of the sen-
tences we follow past examples and parse them
into dependency trees. Dependency parsing has
become recognised as providing a good balance
between deep semantic analysis and simplicity
of parsing procedure. First devised by Gaifman
(1965), it uses a simplified semantic role analysis
to link words by their dependency relations, pro-
viding a bare-bones structural description of the

sentences, which can then be compared.
We used the dependency parsing framework

provided by Pythonâ€™s NLTK toolkit (Bird, 2006).
This in turn wraps around the Java-implemented
Malt parser (Nivre, 2003).
