Figure 1 shows dependency trees for the following
sentences which occur in the WMT 2015 corpus.
All pairs of words shared by both sentences are
aligned, as are ‘started’ and ‘began’.
Hyp: The cellist of Malkki began career.
Ref: Ms Malkki started her career as a cellist.

This comes to a total of 4 Delete operations and
6 Match operations, resulting in a total matching
dist of 10. With the hypothesis tree containing
nH = 7 nodes and the reference containing nR =
9, we can normalise this (as per equation 1) to:

scores = 1−
10

7 + 9
= 0.375

Finally, we may optionally consider a weighting
for the sentence as per equation 3.

weights =
10

10 + 6
= 0.625

This weighting indicates that we consider our
low rating of the sentence partially trustworthy
relative to others in the corpus.

Table 4: System-level correlations of word order metrics with normalised human rankings

for 2015 data are provided in this paper, while
for 2016 the reader is referred to the Findings of
the 2016 Workshop on Machine Translation. For
the latter, DTED uses unflattened trees, without
weighting by aligned nodes. Sentences from all
available into-English corpora were used, but only
segments for which corresponding human judge-
ments were available. The number of individual
systems for each language pair, and the count of
sentences within each, are given in table 5.

Human judgements during the Workshop were
given as rankings between up to 5 systems, with
ties allowed. We have normalised these ranks into
scores out of 1: for example, a rank of 3 between
five systems is converted to 0.5, reflecting that an
equal number of systems were preferred to it as
were considered less good, while a system ranked
best would achieve a perfect score of 1.

It should be noted that while DTED is intended
to evaluate word order in isolation, rankings at
WMT were based on all features of the sentences.
As no data of sufficient quantity and quality was
available for human judgements specifically of
word order, we have used the holistic data. As
such, we do not expect cutting-edge correlational
values for this data; instead, such comparisons are
provided for two separate reasons.

First, as word order is clearly involved in some
non-trivial way in human judgements, we can as-
sume that holistic ranks contain an implicit word
order component. A limited level of similarity
between human judgements and DTED is thus to

be expected, as they are at least partially measur-
ing the same phenomenon. In addition, while the
DTED algorithm is intended to measure word or-
der alone, the structure and alignment of the trees
we use may themselves depend on other factors.
For example, a badly chosen word may occupy
a different role in its sentence than the reference
choice would, resulting in an unpredictable change
in the actions needed to correct it.

Second, if we assume DTED’s results to be suc-
cessfully representative of a sentence’s word or-
der quality and human judgements to contain a
word order component, the level of correlation can
begin to quantify the significance of word order
within the overall judgement. In the ideal theoret-
ical case where DTED perfectly simulated human
intuition on word order, such correlational coef-
ficients would give direct insight into the signif-
icance of that intuition to overall quality judge-
ments.
