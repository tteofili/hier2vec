We have performed analysis on two types of met-
ric: holistic and word order specific. Table 3 com-
pares human judgements to those produced by a
number of well-known and widely used baseline
metrics, while table 4 shows the same values for
metrics designed specifically for word order. In
both tables, the highest score for each corpus is
highlighted.

Meteorâ€™s fragmentation-only subsystem (see
section 2.2) is included in the latter table, while

the version of Meteor in the former is a stan-
dard off-the-shelf installation. For DTED, the W
column indicates whether sentences were consid-
ered equally when aggregating, or were Weighted
based on aligned word content as per section 3.5.
Results run on Flattened trees (section 3.4) are in-
dicated by the column F.

All scores except those for DTED and Meteor
were calculated using implementations of the met-
rics provided with the well-known open-source
system Moses (Koehn et al., 2007). In all cases,
the numbers shown are Pearson correlation coef-
ficients between the output of the given metric at
the system level and the normalised human judge-
ments provided at WMT 2015.
