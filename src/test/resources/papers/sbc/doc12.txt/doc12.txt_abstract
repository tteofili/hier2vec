Abstract

We present DTED, a submission to the
WMT 2016 Metrics Task using struc-
tural information generated by depen-
dency parsing and evaluated using tree edit
distances. In this paper we apply this sys-
tem to translations produced during WMT
2015, and compare our scores with human
rankings from that year. We find moder-
ate correlations, despite the human judge-
ments being based on all aspects of the
sentences while our metric is based only
on word order.
