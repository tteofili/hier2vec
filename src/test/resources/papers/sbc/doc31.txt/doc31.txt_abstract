Abstract

This paper describes the hierarchical
phrase-based machine translation system
built jointly by the University of Ed-
inburgh and the University of Munich
(LMU) for the shared translation task
at the ACL 2016 First Conference on
Machine Translation (WMT16). The
WMT16 Edinburgh/LMU system was
trained for translation of news domain
texts from English into Romanian. We
participated in the shared task for machine
translation of news under “constrained”
conditions, i.e. using the provided training
data only.
