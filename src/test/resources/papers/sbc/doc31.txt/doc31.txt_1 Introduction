While translation between English and many other
European languages (such as Czech and Ger-
man) has a long tradition in the shared tasks
at the series of WMT workshops preceding the
ACL 2016 First Conference on Machine Transla-
tion, English–Romanian has only been introduced
this year as a new language pair.1 The English–
Romanian language pair has received less atten-
tion by the machine translation scientific commu-
nity to date. The availability of a novel standard-
ized evaluation scenario for English–Romanian in
the framework of WMT facilitates research on that
specific language pair.

In this work, we utilize the corpora that have
been provided by the shared task organizers to en-
gineer a competitive system for statistical machine
translation (SMT) from English into Romanian.
We specifically focus on studying machine transla-
tion into Romanian (rather than the inverse transla-
tion direction: from Romanian into English), thus

aiming at making documents originally written in
English available to a large community of speakers
in their native language, Romanian. Applications
are for instance in the health care sector, where, as
part of the Health in my Language project (HimL),
several project partners intend to make public
health information available in a wider variety of
languages.2 The WMT task provides an inter-
esting test bed for English→Romanian machine
translation, though adaptation towards the specific
domain (consumer health for HimL, rather than
news) is also an important aspect that has to be
considered in practice (Huck et al., 2015).

We investigate the effectiveness of hierarchi-
cal phrase-based translation (Chiang, 2005) for
English→Romanian, a statistical machine trans-
lation paradigm that is closely related to phrase-
based translation, but allows for phrases with gaps.
Conceptionally, the translation model is formal-
ized as a synchronous context-free grammar. We
integrate several non-standard enhancements into
our hierarchical phrase-based system and empiri-
cally evaluate their impact on translation quality.

Our system is furthermore one component in
a combination of systems by members of the
HimL project and another EU-funded project,
QT21.3 Measured in BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002),
the QT21/HimL submission yields top transla-
tion quality amongst the shared task submissions.4

The QT21/HimL submission highlights the con-
tinued success of system combinations based on
the Jane machine translation toolkit (Freitag et
al., 2014a) in open evaluation campaigns (Freitag
et al., 2013; Freitag et al., 2014b; Freitag et al.,
2014c). A description of the QT21/HimL com-
bined submission is given by Peter et al. (2016).

We proceed by presenting the particularities of
our hierarchical phrase-based system, with a fo-
cus of interest on exploring non-standard enhance-
ments and non-default configuration settings such
as:

• Individual language models as features,
rather than a single linearly interpolated lan-
guage model; and another background lan-
guage model estimated over concatenated
corpora.

• Large CommonCrawl language model train-
ing data.

• Unpruned language models.
• More hierarchical rules than in default sys-

tems, by means of imposing less strict extrac-
tion constraints.

• A phrase orientation model for hierarchical
translation (Huck et al., 2013).

• Lightly-supervised training (Schwenk, 2008;
Schwenk and Senellart, 2009; Huck et al.,
2011).

• Larger development data for tuning.

All our experiments are run with the open
source Moses implementation (Hoang et al.,
2009) of the hierarchical phrase-based translation
paradigm.
