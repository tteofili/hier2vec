We built a hierarchical phrase-based system for
translation of news texts from English into Roma-
nian. By enhancing the system with non-standard
components, we have been able to achieve an over-
all improvement over a plain hierarchical baseline
of +2.9 BLEU points on the newstest2016 set.

Our Moses reimplementation of the phrase ori-
entation model for hierarchical machine transla-
tion (Huck et al., 2013) has been released as part
of Moses on GitHub.9
