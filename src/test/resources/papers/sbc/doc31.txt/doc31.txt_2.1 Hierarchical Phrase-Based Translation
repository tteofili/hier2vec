In hierarchical phrase-based translation, a proba-
bilistic synchronous context-free grammar is in-
duced from bilingual training corpora. In addi-
tion to continuous lexical phrases as in standard
phrase-based translation, hierarchical phrases
with (usually) up to two non-terminals are ex-
tracted from the word-aligned parallel training
data.

The non-terminal set of a standard hierarchical
grammar comprises two symbols which are shared
by source and target: the initial symbol S and one
generic non-terminal symbol X. The initial sym-
bol S is the start symbol of the grammar. The
generic non-terminal X is used as a placeholder for
the gaps within the right-hand side of hierarchical
translation rules as well as on all left-hand sides
of the translation rules that are extracted from the
parallel training corpus.

Extracted rules of a standard hierarchical gram-
mar are of the form X → 〈α,β ,∼ 〉 where 〈α,β 〉

is a bilingual phrase pair that may contain X, i.e.
α ∈ ({X}∪VF)+ and β ∈ ({X}∪VE)+, where VF
and VE are the source and target vocabulary, re-
spectively. The non-terminals on the source side
and on the target side of hierarchical rules are
linked in a one-to-one correspondence. The ∼ re-
lation defines this one-to-one correspondence.

In addition to the extracted rules, a non-
lexicalized glue rule

S→ 〈S∼0X∼1,S∼0X∼1〉 (1)
is incorporated into the hierarchical grammar that
the system can use for serial concatenation of
phrases as in monotonic phrase-based translation.

In the Moses implementation, the decoder in-
ternally adds a sentence start terminal symbol <s>
and a sentence end terminal symbol </s> to the
input before and after each sentence, respectively.
Therefore, two more special rules

S→ 〈<s>,<s>〉
S→ 〈S∼0</s>,S∼0</s>〉

(2)

are included which allow the decoder to finalize its
translations.

Hierarchical search is conducted with a cus-
tomized version of the CYK+ parsing algorithm
(Chappelier and Rajman, 1998) and cube pruning
(Chiang, 2007). A hypergraph which represents
the whole parsing space is built employing CYK+.
Cube pruning operates in bottom-up topological
order on this hypergraph and expands at most k
derivations at each hypernode.
