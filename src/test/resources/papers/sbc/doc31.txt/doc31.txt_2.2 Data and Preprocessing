Our system is trained using only permissible Ro-
manian monolingual and English–Romanian par-
allel corpora provided by the organizers of the
WMT16 shared task for machine translation of
news: Europarl (Koehn, 2005), SETimes2 (Ty-
ers and Alperen, 2010), News Crawl articles from
2015 (denoted as news2015 hereafter), and Com-
monCrawl (Buck et al., 2014).

The target side of the data is preprocessed with
tokro, LIMSI’s tokenizer for Romanian (Al-
lauzen et al., 2016).5 The English source side
is tokenized using the tokenizer.perl script
from the Moses toolkit. Romanian and English
sentences are both frequent-cased (with Moses’
truecase.perl).

We split the development set newsdev2016 into
two halves (newsdev2016_1 with the first 1000
sentences and newsdev2016_2 with the last 999
sentences). During the system building pro-
cess, we measure progress by evaluating on news-
dev2016_2 as our internal unseen test set, while
only newsdev2016_1 is utilized for tuning.
