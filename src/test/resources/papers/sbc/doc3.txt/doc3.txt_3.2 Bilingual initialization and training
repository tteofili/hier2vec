In the joint semantic space of words across two lan-

guages, the Chinese word ‘政府’ is expected to be

close to its English translation ‘government’. At the

same time, when two words are not direct transla-

tions, e.g. ‘lake’ and the Chinese word ‘潭’ (deep

pond), their semantic proximity could be correctly

quantified.

We describe in the next sub-sections the methods

to intialize and train bilingual embeddings. These

methods ensure that bilingual embeddings retain

their translational equivalence while their distribu-

tional semantics are improved during online training

with a monolingual corpus.
