We evaluate the Mandarin Chinese embeddings with

the semantic similarity test-set provided by the or-

3Fifth Edition. LDC catelog number LDC2011T13. We only

exclude cna cmn, the Traditional Chinese segment of the cor-

pus.

ganizers of SemEval-2012 Task 4. This test-set con-

tains 297 Chinese word pairs with similarity scores

estimated by humans.

The results for semantic similarity are shown in

Table 1. We show two evaluation metrics: Spear-

man Correlation and Kendall’s Tau. For both, bilin-

gual embeddings trained with the combined objec-

tive defined by Equation 5 perform best. For pruned

tf-idf, we follow Reisinger et al. (2010; Huang et

al. (2012) and count word co-occurrences in a 10-

word window. We use the best results from a

range of pruning and feature thresholds to compare

against our method. The bilingual and monolingual

trained embeddings4 out-perform pruned tf-idf by

14.1 and 12.6 Spearman Correlation (×100), respec-
tively. Further, they out-perform embeddings initial-

ized from alignment by 7.9 and 6.4. Both our tf-idf

implementation and the word embeddings have sig-

nificantly higher Kendall’s Tau value compared to

Prior work (Jin and Wu, 2012). We verified Tau cal-

culations with original submissions provided by the

authors.
