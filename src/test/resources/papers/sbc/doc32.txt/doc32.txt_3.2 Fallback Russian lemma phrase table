To augment source coverage, we used an addi-
tional phrase table trained on source lemmas in
a similar fashion to the regular phrase table de-
scribed in Section 2.2. We combined the two ta-
bles statically prior to decoding, into a single ta-

329



ble with non-lemmatized source phrases. For a
given source text and its lemmatized version, we
first create an expansion phrase table with an entry
for each source phrase in the text whose lemma-
tized form is present in the lemmatized phrase ta-
ble. The target phrase and scores for the entry are
obtained from the lemmatized table; that is, entries
for different surface forms of the same lemma will
have identical scores in the expansion table. We
then linearly interpolate the regular and expansion
tables, using epsilon probabilities for missing en-
tries, and a weight of 0.9 on the regular table.1 The
combined table is used in a standard way during
decoding.
