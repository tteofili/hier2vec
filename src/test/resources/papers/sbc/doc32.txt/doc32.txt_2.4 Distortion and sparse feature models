Similar to the translation model, our hierarchi-
cal distortion model and sparse feature model are
based on Russian words but are built on the lem-
matized alignment. The sparse feature model con-
sists of the standard sparse features proposed in

Hopkins and May (2011) and sparse hierarchi-
cal distortion model features proposed in Cherry
(2013).
