The decoder was used to translate the lowercased,
rescored output to mixed case using a target side
LM and a truecase map. The 3-gram truecasing
LM was trained on the target side of all the WMT
parallel training data as well as the WMT mono-
lingual English corpus described in Section 2.1.
Beginning of sentence case was normalized be-
fore training the LM. In addition, casing informa-
tion was transferred heuristically from the source
to the target for OOVs and title/upper cased multi-
word sequences. Beginning-of-sentence case was
also restored. There were no OOVs because of

transliteration (Section 3.3), so case for translit-
erated words was restored via a post-processing
script. As a final step, the output was detokenized
with rule-based methods.
