Abstract

We describe the statistical machine trans-
lation system developed at the National
Research Council of Canada (NRC) for
the Russian-English news translation task
of the First Conference on Machine Trans-
lation (WMT 2016). Our submission is
a phrase-based SMT system that tackles
the morphological complexity of Russian
through comprehensive use of lemmatiza-
tion. The core of our lemmatization strat-
egy is to use different views of Russian for
different SMT components: word align-
ment and bilingual neural network lan-
guage models use lemmas, while sparse
features and reordering models use fully
inflected forms. Some components, such
as the phrase table, use both views of the
source. Russian words that remain out-of-
vocabulary (OOV) after lemmatization are
transliterated into English using a statisti-
cal model trained on examples mined from
the parallel training corpus. The NRC
Russian-English MT system achieved the
highest uncased BLEU and the lowest
TER scores among the eight participants
in WMT 2016.
