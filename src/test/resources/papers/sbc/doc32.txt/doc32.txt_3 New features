Our success in using Russian lemmas to improve
word alignment and NNJMs to improve the over-
all system performance has inspired us to fur-
ther develop new components to leverage these
ideas. In this section, we describe the new fea-
tures integrated with Portage in our submitted sys-
tem: a neural network lexical translation model
(NNLTM), a fallback Russian lemma phrase table,
and a semi-supervised transliteration model.
