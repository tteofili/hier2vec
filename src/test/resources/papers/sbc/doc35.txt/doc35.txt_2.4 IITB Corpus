IIT Bombay English-Hindi corpus contains English-Hindi parallel corpus (IITB-EH) as well as mono-
lingual Hindi corpus collected from a variety of existing sources and corpora developed at the Center
for Indian Language Technology, IIT Bombay over the years. This corpus was used for mixed domain
subtasks H↔E. Furthermore, mixed domain subtasks H↔J were added as a pivot language task with a
parallel corpus created using openly available corpora (IITB-JH) 6. Most sentence pairs in IITB-JH come
from the Bible corpus. The statistics for each corpus are described in Table4.
