The training data for ASPEC-JE was constructed by the NICT from approximately 2 million Japanese-
English scientific paper abstracts owned by the JST. Because the abstracts are comparable corpora, the
sentence correspondences are found automatically using the method from (Utiyama and Isahara, 2007).
Each sentence pair is accompanied by a similarity score and the field symbol. The similarity scores are
calculated by the method from (Utiyama and Isahara, 2007). The field symbols are single letters A-Z and
show the scientific field for each document5. The correspondence between the symbols and field names,
along with the frequency and occurrence ratios for the training data, are given in the README file from
ASPEC-JE.
The development, development-test and test data were extracted from parallel sentences from the

Japanese-English paper abstracts owned by JST that are not contained in the training data. Each data
set contains 400 documents. Furthermore, the data has been selected to contain the same relative field
coverage across each data set. The document alignment was conducted automatically and only docu-
ments with a 1-to-1 alignment are included. It is therefore possible to restore the original documents.
The format is the same as for the training data except that there is no similarity score.
