Figure 15 shows the chronological evaluation results of 4 subtasks of ASPEC and 2 subtasks of JPC. The
Kyoto-U (2016) (Cromieres et al., 2016), ntt (2016) (Sudoh and Nagata, 2016) and naver (2015) (Lee et
al., 2015) are NMT systems, the NAIST (2015) (Neubig et al., 2015) is a forest-to-string SMT system,
Kyoto-U (2015) (Richardson et al., 2015) is a dependency tree-to-tree EBMT system and JAPIO (2016)
(Kinoshita et al., 2016) system is a phrase-based SMT system.
What we can see is that in ASPEC-JE and EJ, the overall quality is improved from the last year, but

the ratio of grade 5 is decreased. This is because the NMT systems can output much fluent translations

but the adequacy is worse. As for ASPEC-JC and CJ, the quality is very much improved. Literatures
(Junczys-Dowmunt et al., 2016) say that Chinese receives the biggest benefits from NMT.
The translation quality of JPC-CJ does not so much varied from the last year, but that of JPC-KJ is

much worse. Unfortunately, the best systems participated last year did not participate this year, so it is
not directly comparable.
