JPC was constructed by the Japan Patent Office (JPO). It consists of a Chinese-Japanese patent de-
scription corpus (JPC-CJ), Korean-Japanese patent description corpus (JPC-KJ) and English-Japanese
patent description corpus (JPC-EJ) with four sections, which are Chemistry, Electricity, Mechanical en-
gineering, and Physics, based on International Patent Classification (IPC). Each corpus is separated into

training, development, development-test and test data, which are sentence pairs. This corpus was used
for patent subtasks C↔J, K↔J and E↔J. The statistics for each corpus are described in Table2.
The Sentence pairs in each data were randomly extracted from a description part of comparable patent

documents under the condition that a similarity score between sentences is greater than or equal to the
threshold value 0.05. The similarity score was calculated by the method from (Utiyama and Isahara,
2007) as with ASPEC. Document pairs which were used to extract sentence pairs for each data were
not used for the other data. Furthermore, the sentence pairs were extracted to be same number among
the four sections. The maximize number of sentence pairs which are extracted from one document pair
was limited to 60 for training data and 20 for the development, development-test and test data. The
training data for JPC-CJ was made with sentence pairs of Chinese-Japanese patent documents published
in 2012. For JPC-KJ and JPC-EJ, the training data was extracted from sentence pairs of Korean-Japanese
and English-Japanese patent documents published in 2011 and 2012. The development, development-
test and test data for JPC-CJ, JPC-KJ and JPC-EJ were respectively made with 100 patent documents
published in 2013.
