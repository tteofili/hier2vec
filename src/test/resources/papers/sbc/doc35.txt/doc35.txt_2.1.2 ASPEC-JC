ASPEC-JC is a parallel corpus consisting of Japanese scientific papers from the literature database and
electronic journal site J-STAGE of JST that have been translated to Chinese with permission from the
necessary academic associations. The parts selected were abstracts and paragraph units from the body
text, as these contain the highest overall vocabulary coverage.
The development, development-test and test data are extracted at random from documents containing

single paragraphs across the entire corpus. Each set contains 400 paragraphs (documents). Therefore,
there are no documents sharing the same data across the training, development, development-test and
test sets.
