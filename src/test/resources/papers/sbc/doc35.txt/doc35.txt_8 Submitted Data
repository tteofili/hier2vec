The number of published automatic evaluation results for the 15 teams exceeded 400 before the start of
WAT2016, and 63 translation results for pairwise evaluation were submitted by 14 teams. Furthermore,
we selected maximum 3 translation results from each subtask and evaluated them for JPO adequacy
evaluation. We will organize the all of the submitted data for human evaluation and make this public.
