We conducted pairwise evaluation of each of the 400 test sentences. The input sentence and two transla-
tions (the baseline and a submission) are shown to the annotators, and the annotators are asked to judge
which of the translation is better, or if they are of the same quality. The order of the two translations are
at random.
