ASPEC is constructed by the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) in collaboration with the
National Institute of Information and Communications Technology (NICT). It consists of a Japanese-
English scientific paper abstract corpus (ASPEC-JE), which is used for J↔E subtasks, and a Japanese-
Chinese scientific paper excerpt corpus (ASPEC-JC), which is used for J↔C subtasks. The statistics for
each corpus are described in Table1.
