The participantsâ€™ systems, which achieved the top 3 highest scores among the pairwise evaluation results
of each subtask22, were also evaluated with the JPO adequacy evaluation. The JPO adequacy evaluation
was carried out by translation experts with a quality evaluation criterion for translated patent documents
which the Japanese Patent Office (JPO) decided. For each system, two annotators evaluate the test
sentences to guarantee the quality.
