Table 6 shows the JPO adequacy criterion from 5 to 1. The evaluation is performed subjectively. “Im-
portant information” represents the technical factors and their relationships. The degree of importance
of each element is also considered to evaluate. The percentages in each grade are rough indications for
the transmission degree of the source sentence meanings. The detailed criterion can be found on the JPO
document (in Japanese) 23.
