The pairwise evaluation is the same as the last year, but not using the crowdsourcing this year. We asked
professional translation company to do pairwise evaluation. The cost of pairwise evaluation per sentence
is almost the same to that of last year.
We randomly chose 400 sentences from the Test set for the pairwise evaluation. We used the same

sentences as the last year for the continuous subtasks. Each submission is compared with the baseline
translation (Phrase-based SMT, described in Section 3) and given a Pairwise score21.
