We used the following data for training the SMT baseline systems.

• Training data for the language model: All of the target language sentences in the parallel corpus.
• Training data for the translation model: Sentences that were 40 words or less in length. (For ASPEC
Japanese–English training data, we only used train-1.txt, which consists of one million parallel
sentence pairs with high similarity scores.)

• Development data for tuning: All of the development data.
