We used the Berkeley parser to obtain source language syntax. We used the following Moses configura-
tion for the baseline tree-to-string syntax-based SMT system.

• max-chart-span = 1000
• Phrase score option: GoodTuring
• Phrase extraction options: MaxSpan = 1000, MinHoleSource = 1, MinWords = 0, NonTermCon-
secSource, and AllowOnlyUnalignedWords.

The default values were used for the other system parameters.
