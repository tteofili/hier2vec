Human evaluations were conducted as pairwise comparisons between the translation results for a specific
baseline system and translation results for each participant’s system. That is, the specific baseline system
was the standard for human evaluation. A phrase-based statistical machine translation (SMT) system
was adopted as the specific baseline system at WAT 2016, which is the same system as that at WAT 2014
and WAT 2015.
In addition to the results for the baseline phrase-based SMT system, we produced results for the base-

line systems that consisted of a hierarchical phrase-based SMT system, a string-to-tree syntax-based

SMT system, a tree-to-string syntax-based SMT system, seven commercial rule-based machine trans-
lation (RBMT) systems, and two online translation systems. The SMT baseline systems consisted of
publicly available software, and the procedures for building the systems and for translating using the
systems were published on the WAT web page7. We used Moses (Koehn et al., 2007; Hoang et al., 2009)
as the implementation of the baseline SMT systems. The Berkeley parser (Petrov et al., 2006) was used
to obtain syntactic annotations. The baseline systems are shown in Table 5.
The commercial RBMT systems and the online translation systems were operated by the organizers.

We note that these RBMT companies and online translation companies did not submit themselves. Be-
cause our objective is not to compare commercial RBMT systems or online translation systems from
companies that did not themselves participate, the system IDs of these systems are anonymous in this
paper.
