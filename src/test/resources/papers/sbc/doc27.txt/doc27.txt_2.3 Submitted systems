We received 102 submissions from 24 institu-
tions. The participating institutions and their entry
names are listed in Table 2; each system did not
necessarily appear in all translation tasks. We also
included 36 online statistical MT systems (origi-
nating from 4 services), which we anonymized as
ONLINE-A,B,F,G.

For presentation of the results, systems are
treated as either constrained or unconstrained, de-
pending on whether their models were trained only
on the provided data. Since we do not know how
they were built, these online and commercial sys-
tems are treated as unconstrained during the auto-
matic and human evaluations.
