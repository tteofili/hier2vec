Abstract

This paper presents the results of the
WMT16 shared tasks, which included five
machine translation (MT) tasks (standard
news, IT-domain, biomedical, multimodal,
pronoun), three evaluation tasks (metrics,
tuning, run-time estimation of MT qual-
ity), and an automatic post-editing task
and bilingual document alignment task.
This year, 102 MT systems from 24 in-
stitutions (plus 36 anonymized online sys-
tems) were submitted to the 12 translation
directions in the news translation task. The
IT-domain task received 31 submissions
from 12 institutions in 7 directions and the
Biomedical task received 15 submissions
systems from 5 institutions. Evaluation
was both automatic and manual (relative
ranking and 100-point scale assessments).

The quality estimation task had three sub-
tasks, with a total of 14 teams, submitting
39 entries. The automatic post-editing task
had a total of 6 teams, submitting 11 en-
tries.
