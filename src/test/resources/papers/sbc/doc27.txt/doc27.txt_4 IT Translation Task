The IT-domain translation task introduced this
year brought several novelties to WMT:

• 4 out of the 7 languages of the IT task are
new in WMT (Bulgarian, Basque, Dutch and
Portuguese),

• adaptation to the IT domain with its specifics
such as frequent named entities (mostly menu
items, names of products and companies) and
technical jargon,

• adaptation to translation of answers in help-
desk service setting (many of the sentences
are instructions with imperative verbs, which
is very rare in the News translation task and
may require adaptation of the whole transla-
tion pipeline, including e.g. part-of-speech
taggers).
