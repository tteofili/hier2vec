The fifth edition of the WMT shared task on
quality estimation (QE) of machine translation
(MT) builds on the previous editions of the task
(Callison-Burch et al., 2012; Bojar et al., 2013,
2014, 2015), with “traditional” tasks at sentence
and word levels, a new task for entire documents
quality prediction, and a variant of the word-level
task: phrase-level estimation.

The goals of this year’s shared task were:

• To advance work on sentence and word-
level quality estimation by providing domain-
specific, larger and professionally annotated
datasets.

• To analyse the effectiveness of different types
of quality labels provided by humans for
longer texts in document-level prediction.

• To investigate quality estimation at a new
level of granularity: phrases.

These goals are addressed through three groups
of tasks: Task 1 at sentence level (Section 6.3),
Task 2 at word and phrase levels (Section 6.4),
and Task 3 at document level (Section 6.6). Tasks
