Five teams participated in the Biomedical Trans-
lation task, submitting a total of 40 runs. Partici-
pants are listed in Table 15; a short description of
their systems is provided below.

Istrionbox The Istrionbox team utilized a non-
log-linear model based on a weighted average of
the translation and language models. They aligned
the training documents on the phrase level using

an aligner based on a lexicon which contains more
than 930,000 terms derived from many parallel
corpora for English/Portuguese. The language
model was based on phrases, instead of words, as
well as the translation model. For the various runs
that the team submitted, they experimented with
assigning equal or different weights for the distinct
models trained on the biological or the health cor-
pora, and they also considered a bilingual lexicon
and named entities.

IXA The IXA team adapted a general-domain
statistical machine translation system to the
biomedical domain. Three approaches were de-
veloped for English-Spanish and Spanish-English
language pairs, using Moses and three corpora
(News corpora, Scielo Health and Scielo Biolog-
ical, both the bilingual and monolingual docu-
ments). In the system used for the first submission,
the medical vocabulary SNOMED-CT is used to
extend the vocabulary to address the problem of
out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words. In the system
used for the second submission, OOV words are

addressed by expanding generated phase tables
with morphological variants and transliterations of
the remaining words. In the system used for the
third submission, the IXA team used the test set
provided by the organizers to optimize the method
used in the second submission.

TALP The TALP team’s system is a standard
phrase-based system based on Moses and MERT
and enhanced with vocabulary expansion using
bilingual word embeddings and a character-based
neural language model with rescoring. The former
focuses on resolving out-of-vocabulary words,
while the latter enhances the fluency of the sys-
tem.

LIMSI-TLP The LIMSI-TLP system is a
MOSES-based statistical machine translation sys-
tem, rescored with Structured Output Layer neu-
ral network models. It relied on additional in-
domain data, including data from the WMT’14
medical translation task (English-French) and a set
of English-French Cochrane systematic review ab-
stracts. They also experiment with a confusion
network system combination which combines the
outputs of Phrase Based SMT systems trained ei-
ther to translate entire source sentences or spe-
cific syntactic constructs extracted from those sen-
tences. The approach is implemented using Con-
fusion Network decoding.

uedin The University of Edinburgh team used
the phrase-based statistical model from Moses in-
cluding hierarchical lexicalized reordering model
with four orientations in both directions. The
translation model was trained on data from the
WMT13, the Scielo training data as well as the
EMEA corpus. The language model was based
on the interpolation of various language models
trained separately on monoligual English corpora,
such as the WMT14 medical, Scielo, EMEA and
English LDC GigaWord corpus.
