The test data for this yearâ€™s task was selected from
online sources, as before. We took about 1500 En-
glish sentences and translated them into the other
5 languages, and then additional 1500 sentences
from each of the other languages and translated
them into English. This gave us test sets of about
3000 sentences for our English-X language pairs,
which have been either originally written in En-
glish and translated into X, or vice versa. The
composition of the test documents is shown in Ta-
ble 1.

The stories were translated by professional
translators, funded by the EU Horizon 2020
projects CRACKER and QT21 (German, Czech,
Romanian), by Yandex2, a Russian search engine
company (Turkish, Russian), and by BAULT, a re-
search community on building and using language
technology funded by the University of Helsinki
(Finnish). For Finnish, a second translation was
provided as well, but not used in the evaluation.
All of the translations were done directly, and not
via an intermediate language.

For Turkish we also released an additional 500
sentence development set, and for Romanian a
third of the test set were released as a development

set instead. For the other languages, test sets from
previous years are available as development sets.
