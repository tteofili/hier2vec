In this section we analyze the errors we observed
in the translations submitted by teams, the lessons
we learned in this first edition of the task and our
plans for future work.

Error analysis. During our manual analysis of a
sample of the translations that were submitted for
the test data, we noticed that their quality is still
poor in comparison to the reference translations.
We identified numerous problems, as summarized
below:

• many missing words or words in the source
language mixed in with the target language,
probably due to words or concepts in the
source language that could not be translated
to the target language;

• incorrect ordering of adjectives and nouns,
given that, in contrast to English, nouns typi-
cally precede adjectives in Portuguese, Span-
ish and French;

• incorrect agreement of nouns, verbs and ad-
jectives with respect to gender and number;

• incorrect punctuation, e.g., periods placed in
the middle of a sentence;

• incorrect casing for words, e.g., common
words which were capitalized or in upper
case;

• missing translations for acronyms, i.e., the
acronym in the source language was used in-
stead.

We note that some of these issues were ignored
during the manual evaluation, for instance, incor-
rect capitalization was not penalized if the trans-
lation was otherwise better or comparable to the
other translation.

Lessons learned. We performed a comparison
of the systems based only on the overall results
on the complete test set and on the samples of sets
that we randomly selected for manual validation.
For this first edition of the Biomedical Translation
task, we aimed at providing an evaluation platform
for the automatic translation of scientific publica-
tions, in particular for titles and abstracts in the
biomedical domain.

In this first edition of the task, the training and
test data was obtained from the parallel publica-
tions available in Scielo. We did not perform
manual translation of the documents for either the
training or the test data, but rather used the origi-
nal text available in Scielo for all languages under
consideration here. In practice, this means that the
reference translations were produced by the arti-
cle authors independently of the WMT challenge
goals. These authors are not professional writers
or professional translators, and some of them may
have limited proficiency in the languages they are
required to use for publication. This situation has
an impact on the quality of the reference trans-
lations, compared to other WMT tasks. It is re-
flected in the manual evaluation which indicates
that for some language pairs (notably English–
Spanish health), participant runs were rated over-
all as better or equal to the reference translation.
Our experience with this first edition of the task
indicates that the Scielo corpus is a valuable re-
source for biomedical WMT, however more work
is needed in terms of quality assurance to ensure
that meaningful evaluation results can be obtained.

Plan for future editions. In next editions, we
plan to build on the established pipeline to collect
and pre-process Scielo data to prepare a new test
dataset. More importantly, we plan to work to-
wards improved data and evaluation quality.

While we initially focused on characterizing
the quality of the alignment in the parallel Scielo
corpus, we are planning to craft a higher quality
dataset by removing any sentence pairs with align-
ment issues. Furthermore, the data set will also be
pruned for sentences exhibiting lexical, grammati-
cal or fluency issues. These steps will contribute to
improve the significance of the evaluation results,
especially in terms of BLEU scores.

Furthermore, we believe that the nature of sci-
entific texts and biomedical texts in particular calls
for specific evaluation metrics. One of the in-
tended uses of translation systems in the biomedi-

cal domain is to provide health professionals with
access to the latest research results that are pub-
lished in a language other than their native lan-
guage. Consequently, health professionals may
use the translated information to make clinical
decisions impacting patients care. It is vital
that translation systems do not contribute to the
dissemination of incorrect clinical information.
Therefore, the evaluation of biomedical translation
systems should include an assessment at the doc-
ument level indicating whether a translation con-
veyed erroneous clinical information.
