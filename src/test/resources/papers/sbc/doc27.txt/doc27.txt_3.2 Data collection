Both examples would be reduced to the following
set of pairwise judgments:

A > B,A = F,A > H,A < J

B < F,B < H,B < J

F > H,F < J

H < J

Here, A > B should be read is “A is ranked
higher than (worse than) B”. Note that by this pro-
cedure, the absolute value of ranks and the mag-
nitude of their differences are discarded. In the

we ignore that for illustration purposes.

case of multi-system outputs, this set of pairwise
rankings would have been produced with less an-
notator effort. This productivity gain grows in the
number of systems that produce identical output,
and this situation is quite common, due in part to
the fact that many systems are built on the same
underlying technology. Table 3 has more details.
