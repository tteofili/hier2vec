This is the first time that we have run the Biomed-
ical Translation task at WMT. This task aims to
evaluate systems for the translation of biomedical
titles and abstracts from scientific publications. In
this first edition of the challenge, we have focused
on three language pairs (considering both trans-
lation directions), namely, English/Portuguese
(EN/PT), English/Spanish (EN/ES) and En-
glish/French (EN/FR), and documents in the two
sub-domains of biological sciences and health sci-
ences.
