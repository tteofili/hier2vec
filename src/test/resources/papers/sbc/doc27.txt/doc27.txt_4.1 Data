The test set consisted of 1000 answers from
the Batch 3 of the QTLeap Corpus.10 The
in-domain training data contained 2000 answers
from the Batches 1 and 2 and also localization
files from several open-source projects (LibreOf-
fice, KDE, VLC) and bilingual dictionaries of IT-
related terms extracted from Wikipedia. The out-
of-domain training data contained all the corpora
from the News Task (see Figure 1), plus PaCo2-
EuEn Basque-English corpus and SETimes with
Bulgarian-English parallel sentences.

“Constrained” systems were restricted to use
only these training data provided by the organiz-
ers. Linguistic tools such as morphological ana-
lyzers, taggers, parsers, word-sense disambigua-
tion or named entity recognizer were allowed in
the constrained condition. The split of Batches 1
and 2 into the training set and development test set
was left to the participants.
