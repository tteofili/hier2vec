The main results are presented in Table 12. The
PROMT-* systems won all three language pairs,
for which they were submitted, but they were
trained using additional training data not avail-
able to other participants, so they are considered
unconstrained and not comparable to the con-
strained systems. In all language pairs except for
Englishâ†’Bulgarian, the baseline (QTL-MOSES)
was outperformed by all other systems.

Table 13 reports the amount of pairwise com-
parisons collected and inter- and intra-annotator
agreement of the human evaluation, which is in a
similar range as in the News task (cf. Tables 4 and
5).
