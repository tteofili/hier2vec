The recurring WMT task examines translation be-
tween English and other languages in the news do-
main. As in the previous years, we include Ger-
man, Czech, Russian, and Finnish. New languages
this years are Romanian and Turkish.

We created a test set for each language pair by
translating newspaper articles and provided train-
ing data.
