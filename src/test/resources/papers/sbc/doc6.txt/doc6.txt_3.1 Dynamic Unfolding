To accommodate source and target sequences of different lengths, the ByteNet uses dynamic
unfolding. The source network builds a representation that has the same width as the source

sequence. At each step the target network takes as input the corresponding column of the
source representation until the target network produces the end-of-sequence symbol. The
source representation is zero-padded on the fly: if the target network produces symbols
beyond the length of the source sequence, the corresponding conditioning column is set to
zero. In the latter case the predictions of the target network are conditioned on source
and target representations from previous steps. Figure 2 represents the dynamic unfolding
process.
