Each layer is wrapped in a residual block that contains additional convolutional layers with
filters of size 1 (He et al., 2015). We adopt two variants of the residual blocks, one with
ReLUs, which is used in the machine translation experiments, and one with Multiplicative
Units (Kalchbrenner et al., 2016b), which is used in the language modelling experiments.
Figure 3 diagrams the two variants of the blocks.
