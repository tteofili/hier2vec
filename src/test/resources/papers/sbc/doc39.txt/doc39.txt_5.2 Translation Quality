Table 1 shows the translation performances measured in BLEU score. Clearly the
proposed COVERAGE-BASED NMT significantly improves the translation quality
in all cases, although there are still considerable differences among different vari-
ants. More specifically,

• NN-based Coverages (Rows 3 and 4 in Table 1): Both variants of NN-
based coverages outperform RNNSearch with averaged gains of 0.63 and
0.94 BLEU points, respectively. Introducing gating activation function im-
proves the performance of coverage models, which is consistent with the
results in other tasks (e.g. (Cho et al.2014b)).

3There are recent progress on aggregating multiple models or enlarging the vocabulary(e.g., in
(Jean et al.2015)), but here we focus on the generic models.

Table 2: Evaluation of alignment quality. For both metrics, the lower the score, the
better the alignment quality.

• Linguistic Coverages (Rows 5 and 6 in Table 1): Two observations can be
made. First, linguistic coverages overall outperforms its NN-based coun-
terparts, indicating that explicitly linguistic regularities are very important
to the attention model. This is further verified on the alignment task (Sec-
tion 5.3). Second, incorporating fertility model boosts performance by better
estimating the covered ratios of source words.
