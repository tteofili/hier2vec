Transition-based dependency parsers (Nivre,
2003; Kübler et al., 2009) typically use two tran-
sitions (LEFT ARC and RIGHT ARC) to introduce
a dependency relation between the token that
is on top of the processing stack and the next
token on the buffer of unprocessed tokens. The
decision to make an attachment, the direction
of attachment, and the label of the attachment
is made by a classifier. Consequently, a good
classifier is tasked to learn syntactic constraints,
ordering preferences, and selectional preferences.

Since transition-based dependency parsers pro-
cess sentences in one deterministic linear-time
left-to-right sweep, the classifier typically has lit-
tle global information. One popular approach
for reducing the effect of early attachment er-
rors is to retain some competition between alter-
native parses using a globally optimized model
with beam search (Zhang and Clark, 2008). Beam
search presents a trade-off between speed (smaller
beam) and higher accuracy (larger beam). More
recently, Dyer et al. (2015) have proposed to
use Long short-term memory networks (LSTMs)
to maintain (unbounded) representations of the
buffer of unprocessed words, previous parsing ac-

tions, and constructed tree fragments.
We believe that in the case of German, the topo-

logical field model can provide a linguistically-
motivated approach for providing the parser with
more global knowledge of the sentence structure.
More concretely, if we give the transition classi-
fier access to topological field annotations, it can
learn regularities with respect to the fields wherein
the head and dependent of a particular dependency
relations lie.

In the remainder of this section, we provide a
short (data-driven) exploration of such regulari-
ties. Since there is a myriad of possible triples2

consisting of relation, head field, and dependent
field, we will focus on dependency relations that
virtually never cross a field and relations that
nearly always cross a field.

Table 2 lists the five dependency relation that
cross fields the least often in the TüBa-D/Z tree-
bank (Telljohann et al., 2006; Versley, 2005) of
German newspaper text. Using these statistics, a
classifier could learn hard constraints with regard
to these dependency relations — they should never
be used to attach heads and dependents that are in
different fields.

Adjective or attr. pronoun 0.04

Table 2: The five dependency relations that most
rarely cross fields in the TüBa-D/Z.

Table 3 lists the five dependency relations that
cross fields most frequently.3 These relations (vir-
tually) always cross fields because they are verbal
attachments and verbs typically form the LK and
RK. This information is somewhat informative,

since a classifier should clearly avoid to attach to-
kens within the same field using one of these re-
lations. However, we can gain more interesting
insights by looking at the dependents’ fields.

Table 3: The five dependency relations that most
frequently cross fields in the TüBa-D/Z.

Table 4 enumerates the three (where applicable)
most frequent head and dependent field combina-
tions of the five relations that always cross fields.
As expected, the head is always in the LK or RK.
Moreover, the dependents are in VF or MF in the
far majority of cases. The actual distributions pro-
vides some insights with respect to these depen-
dency relations. We will discuss the direct object,
prepositional object, and separated verb prefix re-
lations in some more detail.

Direct objects In German, direct objects can
be put in the VF. However, we can see that di-
rect object fronting only happens very rarely in
the TüBa-D/Z. This is in line with earlier obser-
vations in corpus-based studies (c.f. Weber and
Müller (2004)). Since the probability of having a
subject in the VF is much higher, the parser should
attach the head of a noun phrase in the VF as a sub-
ject, unless there is overwhelming evidence to the
contrary, such as case markers, verb agreement, or
other cues (Uszkoreit, 1984; Müller, 1999).

Prepositional objects The dependency annota-
tion scheme used by the TüBa-D/Z makes a dis-
tinction between prepositional phrases that are a
required complement of a verb (prepositional ob-
jects) and other prepositional phrases. Since a sta-
tistical dependency parser does not typically have
access to a valency dictionary, it has difficulty de-

ciding whether a prepositional phrase is a preposi-
tional object or not. Topological field information
can complement verb-preposition co-occurrence
statistics in deciding between these two different
relations. The prepositional object mainly occurs
in MF, while a prepositional phrase headed by the
LK is almost as likely to be in the VF as in the MF
(42.12% and 55.70% respectively).

Separated verb prefixes Some verbs in German
have separable prefixes. A complicating factor in
parsing is that such prefixes are often words that
can also be used by themselves. For example, in
(1-a) fest is a separated prefix of bindet (present
tense third person of festbinden), while in (1-b)
fest is an optional adverbial modifier of gebunden
(the past participle of binden).

Similarly to prepositional objects, a statistical
parser is handicapped by not having an extensive
lexicon. Again, topological fields can complement
co-occurence statistics. In (1-a), fest is in the RK.
As we can see in Table 4, the separated verb pre-
fix is always in the RK. In contrast, an adverbial
modifier as in (1-b) is rarely in the RK (0.35% of
the adverbs cases in the TüBa-D/Z).
