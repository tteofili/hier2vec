Abstract

Neural machine translation (NMT) with re-
current neural networks, has proven to be an
effective technique for end-to-end machine
translation. However, in spite of its promis-
ing advances over traditional translation meth-
ods, it typically suffers from an issue of unbal-
anced outputs, that arise from both the nature
of recurrent neural networks themselves, and
the challenges inherent in machine translation.
To overcome this issue, we propose an agree-
ment model for neural machine translation and
show its effectiveness on large-scale Japanese-
to-English and Chinese-to-English translation
tasks. Our results show the model can achieve
improvements of up to 1.4 BLEU over the
strongest baseline NMT system. With the help
of an ensemble technique, this new end-to-end
NMT approach finally outperformed phrase-
based and hierarchical phrase-based Moses
baselines by up to 5.6 BLEU points.
