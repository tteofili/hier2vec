In this section, we extend the method in (Liu et al.,
2016) to address this issue of unbalanced outputs for
NMT. The key idea is to: 1) train two kinds of NMT,
i.e. one generating targets from left-to-right while
the other from right-to-left; 2) encourage the agree-
ment between them by joint search.
