Table 3 shows the comparison between our method
and the baselines on the CH-EN task.7 The results
were similar in character to the results for JP-EN.
The proposed joint model (NMT-J-5) consistently
outperformed the strongest neural baseline (NMT-
l2r-5), an ensemble of five l2r NMT models, on
all the test sets with gains up to 1.4 BLEU points.
Furthermore, our model again achieved substantial
gains over the Moses and Moses-hier systems, in the
range 1.9âˆ¼5.2 BLEU points, depending on the test
set.
