and Classifier Systems

In this section, we explore the advantages of each
learning approach, as identified in the previous
section, within each learning framework. To this
end, drawing on the strengths of each framework,
we develop new state-of-the-art MT and classifier
systems.2 In the next section, we will use these

are reported with respect to all errors in the test
data. This is different from performance for indi-
vidual errors in Table 6.
