This section presents error analysis of the MT
and classifier approaches. We begin by identify-
ing several key properties that distinguish between
MT systems and classifier systems and that we use
to characterize the learning frameworks and the
outputs of the systems:
(1a) Error coverage denotes the ability of a sys-
tem to identify and correct a variety of error types.
(1b) Error complexity indicates the capacity of a
system to address complex mistakes such as those
where multiple errors interact.

(2) Generalizibility refers to the ability of a sys-
tem to identify mistakes in new unseen contexts
and propose corrections beyond those observed in
training data.
(3) The role of supervision or having annotated
learner data for training.
(4) System flexibility is a property of the system
that allows it to adapt resources specially to correct
various phenomena. The two paradigms are sum-
marized in Table 4. We use + and âˆ’ to indicate
whether a learning framework has desirable (+) or
undesirable characteristic with regard to each fac-
tor.

The first three properties characterize system
output, while (3) and (4) arise from the system
frameworks. Below we analyze the output of sev-
eral state-of-the-art CoNLL-2014 systems in more
detail.1 Section 4 explores (3) and (4) that relate
to the learning frameworks.
