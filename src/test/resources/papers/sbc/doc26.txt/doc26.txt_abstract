Abstract

We focus on two leading state-of-the-art
approaches to grammatical error correc-
tion – machine learning classification and
machine translation. Based on the com-
parative study of the two learning frame-
works and through error analysis of the
output of the state-of-the-art systems, we
identify key strengths and weaknesses of
each of these approaches and demonstrate
their complementarity. In particular, the
machine translation method learns from
parallel data without requiring further lin-
guistic input and is better at correcting
complex mistakes. The classification ap-
proach possesses other desirable charac-
teristics, such as the ability to easily gener-
alize beyond what was seen in training, the
ability to train without human-annotated
data, and the flexibility to adjust knowl-
edge sources for individual error types.

Based on this analysis, we develop an
algorithmic approach that combines the
strengths of both methods. We present
several systems based on resources used
in previous work with a relative improve-
ment of over 20% (and 7.4 F score points)
over the previous state-of-the-art.
