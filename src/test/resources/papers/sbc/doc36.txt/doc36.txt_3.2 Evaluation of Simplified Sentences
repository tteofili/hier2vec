In this section, we evaluate the simplified sentences from the following two aspects, fluency and
readability. From the 200 example sentences that include functional expressions, we removed 36
sentences which are easy sentences since they include no difficult words. We do not need to simplify
such sentences. We then used the remaining 164 sentences for evaluation.
For the evaluation of fluency, we invited three Japanese natives to check the simplified sentences

whether they are natural Japanese sentences. Meanwhile, for readability of the simplified sentences,
we invited three Chinese-speaking learners who are all beginners of Japanese language. To compare
the readability, we provided them with the Chinese translation of the original sentences and simplified
sentences using an online translation software “Google translation” (translate.google.cn). We asked
them to read and judge which sentence is easier to understand. Tables 5 and 6 show the evaluation
results of fluency and readability respectively.

Natural sentences 142 (86.6%)
Unnatural sentences 22 (13.4%)
Total 164 (100%)

Table 5: Evaluation results of fluency of the simplified sentences

Easy to understand 132 (80.5%)
Difficult to understand 32 (19.5%)
Total 164 (100%)

Table 6: Evaluation results of readability of the simplified sentences

According to the evaluation results in Table 6, 80.5% sentences are simplified appropriately and
become easier to understand. Two cases are identified in simplification failure. One is lack of
appropriate simplified rules. For example, “請求しうる ” contains a functional expression “うる
(possible)” with the difficulty level 2. However, no corresponding simplified word for the functional
expression “うる” is found in the current “Simple Japanese Replacement List”. This case cannot be
coped with by lexical simplification. The other is the usage of inappropriate words, which is the main
reason for generation of unnatural simplified sentences. For example, “市内の青果物商を片っ端か
ら尋ねて回った。” was rewritten as “市内の野菜と果物商を一つ一つから尋ねて回った。”,
which is an unnatural sentence that produces unnatural connections for words.
