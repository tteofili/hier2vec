In this section, we randomly extract 200 sentences from the experimental data to examine whether the
identified Japanese functional expressions are correct or not. Table 4 gives the evaluation results of
identification of Japanese functional expressions.

Correct rate Correctly extracted sentences 171 (85.5%)

Error rate Incorrectly extracted sentences 10 (5%) 29 (14.5%)Japanese functional expressions are not recognized 19 (9.5%)
Total 200 (100%)

Table 4: Evaluation results of Japanese functional expression identification

According to Table 4, we obtained 85.5% accuracy for identifying Japanese functional expressions.
Cases of failures of functional expression identification can be viewed from the following three causes.
First, the lack of discriminative contextual information causes failure. For example, “をめぐる(with
related to)” in “決算 を めぐる 政策評価 の 問題”, is incorrectly recognized as a literal usage. Here,
both literal usage and functional usage of this expression share almost the same contexts and cannot be
distinguished only by the surrounding information used in MeCab. Second is the opposite case where
a literal usage is recognized as a functional expression. For example, in “青少年 期 から 身 につけ
て しまう”, “につけて(concerning)” was incorrectly extracted. Third, functional expressions are not
included in the current “Japanese Functional Expressions List”. For example, a colloquial expression
“わけじゃない(it does not mean that)” was not recognized as a functional expression.
