database with 337 types of Japanese compound functional expressions. Shime et al. (2007) proposed
an approach to detecting 59 types of Japanese functional expressions through a machine learning
technique based on a chunking program. However, the major drawback of these studies is in the scale
of Japanese functional expressions, which does not reach the need of the five levels (from N1 to N5)
of the new Japanese-Language Proficiency Test (JLPT).
According to the requirements of the new JLPT, we manually constructed a list of Japanese

functional expressions, which consists of about 680 headwords and 4,000 types of different surface
forms. Here, we consider levels 3-5 as easy level, and levels 1-2 as difficult level, respectively. Table
1 shows some examples of Japanese functional expressions and their surface form variations.

Headword Difficulty Level Surface Forms
たあとで(after) N5 たあとで、た後で、だあとで、だ後で

かもしれない(maybe) N4 かもしれない、かもしれません、かもしれず...
にたいして(to) N3 にたいして、に対して、にたいしては、に対しては...

ざるをえない(have to) N2 ざるをえない、ざるを得ない、ざるをえず、ざるを得ず...
やいなや(as soon as) N1 やいなや、や否や
