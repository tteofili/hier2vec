Text simplification, defined narrowly, is the process of reducing the linguistic complexity of a text,
while retaining the original information contents and meaning (Siddharthan, 2014). Watananabe and
Kawamura (2013) introduced a Japanese simplification system with the use of a “Simple Japanese
Replacement List”. Kaneniwa and Kawamura (2013) used the same list to rewrite difficult vocabulary
automatically for Japanese learners who have non-kanji backgrounds. Kajiwara and Yamamoto (2015),
constructed an evaluation dataset for Japanese lexical simplification. They extracted 2330 sentences
from a newswire corpus and simplified only one difficult word using several Japanese lexical
paraphrasing databases. Kodaira et al. (2016) built a controlled and balanced dataset for Japanese
lexical simplification. They extracted 2010 sentences with only one difficult word in each sentence
from a balanced corpus and collected simplification candidates using crowdsourcing techniques.
Different from the previous research mentioned above, we used a large scale Japanese balanced

corpus to extract simplification candidates for difficult words and through manual selection we
constructed a “Simple Japanese Replacement List” for Chinese-speaking Japanese language learners.
For the levels of word difficulty, we consider levels 3-5 of the new JLPT as easy level, and levels 1-2
as difficult level according to the vocabulary list of the new JLPT, which consists of about 16,000
words. Besides, we consider the words which are not included in the vocabulary list of the new JLPT
as difficult words. Since a large number of Kanji characters are used both in Japanese and in Chinese,
Chinese-speaking learners can easily understand the Japanese words of Chinese origin (Japanese-
Chinese homographs), such as “安全(safety)”, “学習(study)”, “擁立(support)”, or easily guess the
meaning of many Japanese original words with the help of Kanji characters, such as “壊す(break)”,
“打つ (hit)”, “取り消す (cancel)”. Kanji characters in these Japanese words are also included in
Chinese dictionary and have the same or similar meaning with Chinese words. Therefore, we consider
these words as easy words for Chinese-speaking learners, although some of these words are difficult
words in the vocabulary list of the new JLPT.
We obtain a list of similar words associated with each difficult word which we are going to use for

replacement, using Word2vec (https://code.google.com/p/word2vec/). As the training data for the
Word2vec model, we use the Balanced Corpus of Contemporary Written Japanese (Maekawa, 2008),
which consists of about 5,800,000 sentences in various domains. Based on the list of similar words, we
choose easy words which are included in the vocabulary list of new JLPT as simplified words. If there
is no appropriate easy word in the vocabulary list of the new JLPT, we use Japanese-Chinese
homographs whose meaning is the same, or similar to Chinese words based on Japanese dictionaries
(Bunrui goihyo zouhokaiteiban, 2004; Kadokawa ruigo shin jiten, 2002; Kojien 5th Editon, 1998).
Japanese-Chinese homographs for simplification are specific for Chinese-natives. Therefore, our
“Simple Japanese Replacement List” differs from previous research mentioned above on this aspect.

For simplification of Japanese functional expressions, we rewrite some difficult Japanese functional
expressions using easy Japanese functional expressions or easy words in the vocabulary list of the new
JLPT based on a Japanese sentence pattern dictionary (Group Jamasi, Xu. 2001).

Original words Difficulty Level Part of speech Simplified words Difficulty Level
合鍵 (duplicate key) N1 Noun 鍵 (key) N5
負け戦 (defeat) N0 Noun 敗戦 (defeat) N0
出会う(meet) N0 Verb 会う (meet) N5

胸苦しい (tough) N1 Adjective 苦しい (tough) N3
が早いか (when) N1 Functional Expression と (when) N5
の際には (when) N2 Functional Expression の時 (when) N5/N5

Table 2: Examples of the Simple Japanese Replacement List

Finally, we created a “Simple Japanese Replacement List,” which consists of words and functional
expressions. Table 2 shows some examples in the list.
