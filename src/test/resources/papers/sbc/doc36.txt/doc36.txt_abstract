Preface

Welcome to the 3rd Workshop on Natural Language Processing Techniques for Educational Applications
(NLPTEA 2016), with a Shared Task on Chinese Grammatical Error Diagnosis (CGED).

The development of Natural Language Processing (NLP) has advanced to a level that affects the research
landscape of many academic domains and has practical applications in many industrial sectors. On the
other hand, educational environment has also been improved to impact the world society, such as the
emergence of MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses). With these trends, this workshop focuses on the
NLP techniques applied to the educational environment. Research issues in this direction have gained
more and more attention, examples including the activities like the workshops on Innovative Use of NLP
for Building Educational Applications since 2005 and educational data mining conferences since 2008.

This is the third workshop held in the Asian area, with the first one NLPTEA 2014 workshop being
held in conjunction with the 22nd International Conference on Computer in Education (ICCE 2014)
from Nov. 30 to Dec. 4, 2014 in Japan. The second edition NLPTEA 2015 workshop was held in
conjunction with the 53rd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics and the
7th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (ACL-IJCNLP 2015) from July 26-
31 in Beijing, China. This year, we continue to promote this research line by holding the workshop
in conjunction with the COLING 2016 conference and also holding the third shared task on Chinese
Grammatical Error Diagnosis. We receive 14 valid submissions for research issues, each of which was
reviewed by three experts, and have 15 teams participating in the shared task, with 9 of them submitting
their testing results. In total, there are 10 oral papers and 10 posters accepted. We also organize a keynote
speech in this workshop. The invited speaker Professor Glenn Stockwell is expected to deliver a great
talk entitled as "Technology and the Changing Face of Language Education".

We would like to thank the program committee members for their hard work in completing the review
tasks. Their collective efforts achieved quality reviews of the submissions within a few weeks. Great
thanks should also go to the speaker, authors, and participants for the tremendous supports in making the
workshop a success.

Welcome you to the Osaka city, and wish you enjoy the city as well as the workshop.

Abstract

Learning functional expressions is one of the difficulties for language learners, since functional
expressions tend to have multiple meanings and complicated usages in various situations. In
this paper, we report an experiment of simplifying example sentences of Japanese functional
expressions especially for Chinese-speaking learners. For this purpose, we developed
“Japanese Functional Expressions List” and “Simple Japanese Replacement List”. To evaluate
the method, we conduct a small-scale experiment with Chinese-speaking learners on the
effectiveness of the simplified example sentences. The experimental results indicate that the
simplified sentences are helpful in learning Japanese functional expressions.
