In this paper, we presented our attempt to produce simplified example sentences for learning Japanese
functional expressions using “Japanese Functional Expressions List” and “Simple Japanese
Replacement List”. A small-scale experiment was conducted to verify the effectiveness of the
proposed method. The experimental results showed that simplified example sentences are helpful in
learning Japanese functional expressions. In the future, we plan to estimate the difficulty level of the
extracted example sentences automatically and offer better example sentences for Chinese-speaking
learners of Japanese language.

Abstract 

In learning Asian languages, learners encounter the problem of character types that are 
different from those in their first language, for instance, between Chinese characters and the 
Latin alphabet. This problem also affects listening because learners reconstruct letters from 
speech sounds. Hence, special attention should be paid to listening practice for learners of 
Asian languages. However, to our knowledge, few studies have evaluated the ease of listening 
comprehension (listenability) in Asian languages. Therefore, as a pilot study of listenability in 
Asian languages, we developed a measurement method for learners of English in order to 
examine the discriminability of linguistic and learner features. The results showed that the 
accuracy of our method outperformed a simple majority vote, which suggests that a 
combination of linguistic and learner features should be used to measure listenability in Asian 
languages as well as in English. 

1 Introduction 

An important task of language teachers is to choose reading/listening materials appropriate for the 
proficiency of their learners so as to prevent decreases in learning motivation. However, this task can 
be a heavy burden for language teachers when they introduce computer-assisted language 
learning/teaching (CALL/T) techniques. Although CALL/T allows language teachers to use different 
reading/listening materials for each learner, it also increases the number of materials that they must 
evaluate for appropriateness. To address this issue, alternative methods that automatically measure the 
ease of reading comprehension (readability) have been developed. 

However, although the majority of previous studies have addressed the measurement of readability: 
Japanese by Sato et al. (2008); Chinese by Sung et al. (2015), among others, they have not addressed 
the ease of listening comprehension (henceforth, listenability). Several studies have examined 
listenability for English learners (Kiyokawa 1990; Kotani et al. 2014; Kotani & Yoshimi 2016; Yoon 
et al. 2016); however, to the best of our knowledge, no previous studies on listenability for learners of 
Asian languages such as Chinese, Korean, and Japanese have been conducted. 

The method of Kiyokawa (1990) measured listenability based on the length of sentences and the 
difficulty of words. It was hypothesized that the listenability of a sentence decreases as it becomes 
longer and contains more advanced vocabulary words. Kotani et al. (2014) suggested the possibility of 
using different linguistic elements such as phonological features, and addressed this question by 
measuring listenability based on various linguistic features, including speech rate and the frequency of 
phonological modification patterns such as linking. In addition, their method used listening test scores 
as a learner feature to measure listenability relative to proficiency. This is because sentences with less 
listenability for learners at the beginner level might be easy for those at the advanced level. However, 
because that study focused on the accuracy of measurement, the question of discriminability of

linguistic and learner features for the measurement of listenability remained. The discriminability of 
linguistic features was examined by Yoon et al. (2016), who used multiple regression analysis to 
measure listenability; however, they did not examine the discriminability of learner features. Hence, 
the discriminability of both linguistic and learner features still has yet to be examined. 

Given this background, the purpose of this study was to attempt to answer the following two 
research questions by measuring listenability on the basis of linguistic and learner features: 

 
(1) How accurately can listenability be measured using linguistic and learner features? 
(2) Which of linguistic and learner features are discriminative for the measurement of listenability? 
 
To answer these questions, in this study, we developed a listenability measurement method using a 

decision tree classification algorithm (Quinlan 1992) that classifies sentences into five levels of 
listenability in order to determine the accuracy of listenability measurement and the discriminability of 
linguistic and learner features to this classification. Although the linguistic and learner features 
examined were effective for listenability measurement in English, they were not English-specific, 
which suggests that they may also be useful for the measurement of listenability in Asian languages. 

2 Linguistic and Learner Features 

Listenability is measured based on linguistic and learner features. Linguistic features explain the 
difficulty of a sentence, and learner features explain the proficiency of a learner. The linguistic (Chall 
1948; Fang 1966; Kiyokawa 1990; Messerklinger 2006; Kotani et al. 2014; Kotani & Yoshimi 2016; 
Yoon et al. 2016), and learner features (Kotani et al. 2014; Kotani & Yoshimi 2016) used in this study 
were originally described elsewhere. 

Linguistic features consist of sentence length, mean word length, multiple syllable words, word 
difficulty, speech rate, and phonological modification patterns. Sentence length is calculated based on 
the number of words in a sentence. Mean word length is derived from the mean number of syllables 
per word. Multiple syllable words refer to the number of multiple syllable words in a sentence. Word 
difficulty is derived from the rate of words absent from Kiyokawa’s basic vocabulary list for words in 
a sentence. Speech rate is calculated in terms of spoken words per minute. Phonological modification 
patterns are derived from the rate of phonologically modified words in a sentence. The types of 
phonological modification patterns are: elision (elimination of phonemes), in which vowel sounds 
immediately follow a stressed syllable, such as the second “o” sound in “chocolate”; reduction 
(weakening a sound by changing a vowel to a schwa), such as vowel sounds in personal/interrogative 
pronouns, auxiliaries, modals, prepositions, articles, and conjunctions; contraction (combining word 
pairs), such as a modal with a subject noun; linkage (connecting final and initial word sounds), such as 
connected a word ending with an “n” or “r” sound with a word starting with a vowel sound, for 
example, “in an hour” and “after all”; and deduction (elimination of sounds between words), in which 
words share the same sound, for example, “good day”. 

Learner features consist of listening test scores, learning experience, visiting experience, and 
listening frequency. Listening test score refers to scores on the Test of English for International 
Communication (TOEIC). Learning experience refers to the number of months for which learners 
have been studying English. Visiting experience refers to the number of months learners have spent in 
English-speaking countries. Listening frequency refers to scores on a five-point Likert scale for the 
frequency of English use (1: infrequently, 2: somewhat infrequently, 3: moderate, 4: somewhat 
frequently, and 5: frequently). 

3 Training/Test Data 

Training/test data for a decision tree classification algorithm were constructed using the learner corpus 
of Kotani et al. (2014), which includes learners’ judgment of listenability. Listenability was judged by 
learners of English as a foreign language using scores on a five-point Likert scale (1: easy, 2: 
somewhat easy, 3: average, 4: somewhat difficult, or 5: difficult). Scores were judged on a sentence-
by-sentence basis where each learner listened to and assigned scores for 80 sentences from four news 
clips selected from the editorial and special sections for English learners on the Voice of America 
(VOA) website (http://www.voanews.com). News clips in the special section were intended for 

7



 

learners, while news clips in the editorial section were intended for native speakers of English. The 
news clips in the special section consisted of short, simple sentences using the VOA’s basic 
vocabulary of 1,500 words; idiomatic expressions were avoided. By contrast, the news clips in the 
editorial section were made without any restrictions on vocabulary and sentence construction, as long 
as they were appropriate as news clips for native speakers of English. The speech rate of the news 
clips in the special section were two-thirds slower than those in the editorial section, which were read 
aloud at a natural speech rate of approximately 250 syllables per minute (Robb & Gillon 2007). 

The learners were 90 university students (48 males, 42 females; mean age ± SD, 21.5 ± 2.6 years) 
who were compensated for their participation. All learners were asked to submit valid scores from 
TOEIC tests taken in the current or previous year. The mean TOEIC listening score was 334.78 ± 
98.14. The minimum sore was 130 (n = 1), and the maximum score was 495 (n = 8). 

Although the training/test data should have consisted of 7,200 instances (90 learners × 80 sentences) 
for valid listenability measurement, only 6,804 instances were actually observed. Assuming that the 
missing 396 instances resulted from listening difficulties, these instances were scored as having the 
lowest listenability. Most instances (25.2%) were scored in the middle range (3) of listenability, and 
the fewest instances (15.8%) were scored in the high range (2). Listenability scores of 1, 4, and 5 were 
given by 21.7%, 20.8%, and 16.5% of the learners, respectively. 

Table 1 shows the means and SDs of the linguistic and learner features in the training/test data.

4 Experiment 

Listenability was measured on the basis of linguistic and learner features using a decision tree 
classification algorithm implemented on C4.5 software (Quinlan 1992). All settings were taken as 
defaults, and classification was evaluated using five-fold cross validation.

shown in Table 2. The accuracy of classification rate was 47.0% ((1116+293+740+574+661)/7200) in 
the test data. Although this might be insufficient for validating our listenability measurement method, 
we believe that the method can still be judged as valid through a comparison with the accuracy 
attained by a simple majority vote (25.2%) as a baseline. 

We calculated the accuracy for each listenability score from 1 to 5, which is shown as bracketed 
numbers in Table 2. The accuracy varied from 25.8% (293/(299+293+348+125+70)) to 71.4% 
(1116/(1116+190+169+46+42)). As this examination was not conclusive, it remains for the future 
study to examine why the method showed the different accuracies in more detail. 

Using the five-fold cross validation test, five decision trees (I–V) were generated. In four of the five 
decision trees, the same type of linguistic and learner features were allocated at the root nodes, the 
first-level child nodes (child nodes originating from the root nodes), and the second-level child nodes 
(child nodes originating from the first-level child nodes). Parts of the decision tree (I–IV) can be seen 
in Figure 1; the different roots (V) are shown in bold. Part V of the decision tree is shown in Figure 2. 
 

 

Fig. 1. Decision tree (I–IV)                   Fig. 2. Decision tree (V) 

As the listening test score was allocated at the root node of the five decision trees, this feature was 
regarded as the most discriminative. Visiting experience was allocated at the first-level child node of 
the decision trees, and was therefore judged as the second most discriminative feature. The third most 
discriminative feature was regarded as the speech rate, because it was allocated at either the first- or 
second-level child node in each tree. 

5 Conclusion 

In this study, we examined the measurement of listenability for learners of English as a foreign 
language. We found that learner features were discriminative for the measurement accuracy. This 
finding suggests that learner features should be taken into account when measuring listenability for 
learners of Asian languages. 

Although the accuracy was not high, our method outperformed a simple majority vote. In the future, 
using this method as a baseline, we plan on developing a listenability measurement method for Asian 
languages that would outperform that for English.

Abstract

We propose a new approach for extracting argument structure from natural language texts that
contain an underlying argument. Our approach comprises of two phases: Score Assignment and
Structure Prediction. The Score Assignment phase trains models to classify relations between
argument units (Support, Attack or Neutral). To that end, different training strategies have been
explored. We identify different linguistic and lexical features for training the classifiers. Through
ablation study, we observe that our novel use of word-embedding features is most effective for
this task. The Structure Prediction phase makes use of the scores from the Score Assignment
phase to arrive at the optimal structure. We perform experiments on three argumentation datasets,
namely, AraucariaDB, Debatepedia and Wikipedia. We also propose two baselines and observe
that the proposed approach outperforms baseline systems for the final task of Structure Predic-
tion.
