Abstract 

This paper presents rstWeb, a new browser-

based interface for Rhetorical Structure Theo-

ry and other discourse relation annotations. 

Expanding on previous tools for RST, rstWeb 

allows annotators to work online using only a 

browser. Project administrators can easily col-

lect multiple annotations of the same docu-

ments on a central server, keep track of anno-

tation processes and assign tasks and annota-

tion schemes to users. A local version using an 

embedded web framework is also available, 

running offline on a desktop browser under 

the localhost. 

1 Introduction 

Since its introduction by Mann & Thompson 

(1988) Rhetorical Structure Theory has enjoyed 

continuing interest as a framework for the analysis 

of discourse relations, including the development 

of large scale corpora (especially the RST Dis-

course Treebank; RSTDT, Carlson et al. 2003) and 

automatic parsers (Joty et al. 2013, Surdeanu et al. 

2015). However while the development of RST 

corpora and parsing has continued, there has been 

less progress in creating more up-to-date, collabo-

rative and online interfaces for annotation, which 

would facilitate the development of new manually 

annotated data sets. Most work to date has used ei-

ther the original RSTTool (O’Donnell 2000), a lo-

cal desktop application written in Tcl/Tk, or its ex-

tension, the ISI RST Annotation Tool by Daniel 

Marcu (see: http://www.isi.edu/~marcu/ 

discourse/AnnotationSoftware.html). 

Both tools are not being actively developed at pre-

sent, and installing and running them across plat-

forms can be challenging.  

Meanwhile for other annotation tasks, online 

web interfaces have been developed which allow 

annotators to be trained and to work using only a 

browser, substantially facilitating the recruitment, 

curation and validation of data (e.g. Arborator, 

Gerdes 2013 for dependency syntax, or WebAnno, 

Yimam et al. 2013, for a variety of tasks). These 

server-based tools let project managers collect data 

centrally, without exchanging files with annotators, 

and track progress or log annotation processes au-

tomatically, while substantially reducing admin-

istration effort. The software presented here is 

meant to do the same for RST. Specifically it al-

lows: 

 

 Annotation using only a browser 

 Import and export of RSTTool’s .rs3 format 

 Import of plain text (discourse unit per line) 

 Support for multiple annotated versions of 
documents across users 

 Enforcement of uniform annotation schemes 
across users 

 Undo/redo functionality 

 Logging of annotation steps 

 Administration for user assignments, projects 
and guideline links 

 Single mode for adding/deleting spans, multi-
nuclear relations and satellite linking (no 

mode switching, see below) 

The following section describes the technical infra-

structure of rstWeb and the main requirements and 

workflows of the software. Section 3 briefly re-

ports on a project employing rstWeb as an annota-

1



 
 
 
 

tion interface and estimates the reduction of user 

actions compared to previous tools based on anno-

tation logs from RSTDT. Section 4 discusses some 

applications to discourse annotation outside RST. 

Section 5 ends with discussion for further work. 

2 Software architecture 

rstWeb
1
 is written in Python with a SQLite back-

end, and these are required for the server running 

the software. In order to stay light-weight and re-

sponsive, JavaScript is used for the browser-based 

client, making the server-side demand almost no 

resources. jQuery and jsPlumb are used to render 

edges and animations. Following a static form-

submit architecture (cf. Arborator, Gerdes 2013), 

no running services are used: Python scripts are 

exposed via a Web server (e.g. Apache), and call-

ing them from a browser accesses the DB to serial-

ize HTML for the client. For local machine use, a 

service script using the CherryPy framework can 

be used, requiring local users to install Python and 

CherryPy (http://www.cherrypy.org/). The 

software is platform independent, running on Mac, 

Linux and Windows platforms. Figure 1 gives a 

schematic overview of the system’s architecture. 
 

 
Figure 1: rstWeb schematic architecture. 

 

Four scripts are exposed to the user, used to 

open and administrate projects (‘open’ and ‘admin’ 

scripts), and to annotate in two modes described 

below: ‘segmentation’ and ‘structuring’.

 http://corpling.uis.georgetown.edu/rstweb/info  

To annotate documents, users log in to the inter-

face, where they can open any documents that have 

been assigned to them. Each user has their own 

copy of each assigned document, meaning that 

multiple users can annotate the same document in 

parallel for inter-annotator agreement experiments, 

though the tool does not support automatic calcula-

tion of agreement measures at present. Once a 

document has been opened, the user can move 

freely between two modes: segmentation of Ele-

mentary Discourse Units (EDUs), and structuring 

the units into an RST tree (see Figure 3 below). 

In designing the annotation workflow, a central 

objective was to avoid constant switching between 

modes: in RSTTool, segmenting units, linking, un-

linking, grouping them in spans or adding multinu-

clear relations, all required changing the ‘mode’ to 

do just that task; single clicks could then be used to 

carry out the action. This meant it was more con-

venient to complete multiple tasks of the same kind 

(e.g. spanning or unlinking) consecutively, which 

required some planning and reduced flexibility, or 

alternatively that frequent switching needed to be 

done. For rstWeb, the attempt was made to allow 

all operations on any node to be available simulta-

neously. This attempt has been successful for all 

tasks except for segmentation. An initial attempt to 

allow users to segment units within the RST dia-

gram proved cumbersome, since reading EDUs in 

small boxes left-to-right is more difficult than 

reading the running text in one big box.  

As a result, a dedicated segmentation mode was 

developed, the interface for which is shown in Fig-

ure 2. This interface closely resembles RSTTool’s 

segmentation mode.  
 

 
Figure 2: Discourse segmentation editor. 

 

Users can move between modes and choose to re-

segment while structuring: if a unit in a tree is 

segmented, the first portion of the divided segment 

retains the original function, and the second is cre-

ated without attachment. Merging two units causes 

2



 
 
 
 

them to retain the attachment and label of the first 

unit. The tool has client-side undo/redo function-

ality, without submitting to the server, though un-

do/redo steps are logged as in the ISI tool.
2
 

The other mode, structuring, is where the bulk 

of annotation work is done (see Figure 3). rstWeb 

supports the same tree structures as other tools, in-

cluding crossing edges. However unlike earlier 

tools, there is no need to switch between annota-

tion modes to connect or unlink nodes, add spans, 

or add multinuclear relations. These actions are 

handled by small buttons surrounding each node 

junction: X for unlinking, T for adding a span and Λ 

for multinuclear nodes (see Figure 3). User reports 

suggest that this facilitates annotation substantially. 

Finally, administrators can manage user as-

signments and import documents from plain text 

files (one EDU per line) or .rs3 files (RSTTool 

format), or export annotations in .rs3 format.
3
 

Documents can be grouped into projects, which 

can be given a guidelines URL for users to consult.  

3 Annotating in rstWeb 

rstWeb has been employed in the annotation of the 

GUM corpus (Zeldes 2016)
4
, an open-access multi-

layer corpus including RST analyses, constructed 

                                                      
2 Step logging has been used in the evaluation of annotation 

methodology, for example in Marcu et al. (1999). 
3 This format can also be imported into corpus search tools 

supporting RST, such as ANNIS (Krause & Zeldes 2016). 
4 http://corpling.uis.georgetown.edu/gum 

via classroom annotation and extended yearly. The 

corpus contains texts from 4 genres: travel guides, 

how-to guides, online news and interviews. In the 

most recent round of data collection, encompassing 

29 documents, RST annotation was done with rst-

Web, instead of the previously used RSTTool. 

Documents were comparable in length (Ø 58.31 

EDUs) with those in the RST Discourse Treebank 

with Ø 56.59 EDUs (Carlson et al. 2003). This 

suggests that the system can be used successfully 

for text sizes on par with the benchmark resource 

for RST. The amount of errors based on instructor 

corrections using rstWeb compared to RSTTool 

was very similar (see Zeldes 2016). 

To give an idea of the mode changes required 

by a multi-mode workflow, switching between 

linking/unlinking/grouping and creating multinu-

clear clusters as in older tools, we can examine an-

notation step files from the RST Discourse Tree-

banks. Table 1 gives the necessary mode change 

rates per node (including non-terminals), and the 

proportion of changes per annotation step in 10 

random Wall Street Journal documents from 

RSTDT (including undo actions, but excluding 

segmentation operations). 

Although the tools are different and therefore 

hard to compare directly, rstWeb logs from the 

GUM data suggest a similar rate of Ø 0.43 action 

type changes per step, indicating that annotators 

generally use mode changes as needed in either 

environment, meaning the multimode interface 

should save a substantial amount of clicking. 

Figure 3: Structurer interface with an RST tree. The three buttons around each node allow users to unlink edg-

es, create grouping spans or add multinuclear clusters above nodes, without switching annotation modes.

During a previous round of data collection for 

GUM, RST annotations for the same corpus with 

the same text types were created using RSTTool. 

Feedback from students who switched from work-

ing with RSTTool to rstWeb, as well as from in-

structors (including a trained teaching assistant), 

has been very positive. 

4 Using rstWeb for other resources 

Data has successfully been imported into rstWeb 

from several existing RST-annotated sources, in-

cluding the RST Discourse Treebank (converted to 

.rs3) and the German Potsdam Commentary Cor-

pus (Stede & Neumann 2014). Although the soft-

ware has been designed specifically for RST anno-

tation, it may be possible to use it for other types of 

annotation, especially those representing binary re-

lations between clauses. In particular, it is possible 

to disable the buttons generating spans and/or mul-

tinuclear nodes: this could be useful for other 

(shallow) discourse parsing frameworks or subsets 

of these, in which annotators would not be allowed 

to create multinuclear nodes or possibly any form 

of hierarchy. 

For some forms of annotation, and particularly 

for explicit connectives (e.g. marking up a word 

such as ‘because’) and gaps inside clauses (clause 

parts with no relations), as used e.g. in the Penn 

Discourse Treebank (Prasad et al. 2008), the inter-

face is not suitable, since each unit of annotation 

must be broken off as a segment. For connectives, 

this could be a single word, which would be im-

practical to view in the RST style diagram. How-

ever for simple binary relation classification be-

tween clauses with similar schemas, the ad-

vantages of the online, browser-based interface 

may make it a useful option (cf. Figure 4, using the 

Expansion.Conjunction and Expan-

sion.Restatement relations from PDTB; multinu-

clear buttons have been disabled, but hierarchies 

are still enabled).

connective annotation. Multinuclear buttons are disabled. 

5 Conclusion 

rstWeb offers a new, actively maintained tool for 

online, browser-based annotation of Rhetorical 

Structure Theory. The static script strategy of the 

backend means that server load when running rst-

Web is negligible: it is not running at all unless a 

user has just submitted or requested data. Using 

CherryPy as a localhost container means that serv-

er code can be used offline or by single users who 

do not have access to a server – all code updates to 

the server version carry over to the local version. 

Using the browser as an interface means that users 

can work in a familiar environment, without in-

stalling software (at least for server based pro-

jects), that administrators do not need to exchange 

files with annotators, and that the system is cross-

platform compatible without resorting to heavier 

Java based frameworks.  

In future work, some additional features could 

be added to the software. In particular, it is current-

ly not possible to edit the inventory of RST rela-

tions after the import of a document. Also, support 

for ‘schemas’, i.e. added span annotations to mark 

a unit as a ‘title’ etc., which was supported in pre-

vious tools, is not currently implemented, but is 

planned for an upcoming version. Finally, built in 

facilities for measuring inter-annotator agreement 

are interesting possible addition to the software.

Abstract

We present the design and evaluation of a
web-based peer review system that uses natu-
ral language processing to automatically eval-
uate and provide instant feedback regarding
the presence of solutions in peer reviews. Stu-
dent reviewers can then choose to either revise
their reviews to address the system’s feedback,
or ignore the feedback and submit their orig-
inal reviews. A system deployment in multi-
ple high school classrooms shows that our so-
lution prediction model triggers instant feed-
back with high precision, and that the feed-
back is successful in increasing the number of
peer reviews with solutions.
