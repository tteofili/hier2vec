Although our method can handle more than 90 percent rare
words in the data, there are still some remain untackled,
which can be divided into two categories as follows.

One is related with complex alignments. As described in
section 3.1, we only handle one to one and one to zero (zero to
one) mapping in this paper. there are also some one to many
(many to one) and many to many alignments in the data. Here
is an example,

ÿÅ⌥��€y∆á˜
and indicating the import ratification number

the rare word ’á˜’ (document number) at the end of
the source sentence aligns to two target word ’ratification’
and ’number’, and the target word ’ratification’ also aligns
to the second to last word ’y∆’ (ratification). If we focus

on word level replacement, then replacing both ’ratification’
and ’number’ with the translation of a word similar to ’á˜’
will make the source word ’y∆’ unaligned. So it’s better
to do the replacement at phrase level. But how to find alter-
natives for phases remains a problem and it will be leaved as
our future work.

The other class of untackled rare words are related with the
similarity model. According to Zipf’s law [Zipf, 1949], it’s
impossible to contain all words from a language in a corpus
with limited size. And for speed and quality3 considerations,
we also don’t train word vectors for words which appear less
than 5 times in the mono-lingual data. So for those really
rare words which are not seen or only seen a few times in the
mono-lingual data, we cannot find words similar to them. Ac-
cording to our investigation, most of these really rare words
belong to named entities, including number, person names,
location names and organization names. With an extra named
entity recognizer, we can replace these rare named entities
with their type labels instead of similar words. And this will
also be leaved as our feature work.
