Distributed word representation has been shown powerful to
capture syntactic and semantic information about words, and
it is widely applied in various tasks [Turian et al., 2010]. We
adopt it here to find the most similar word for a given word w
as follows,

w

⇤
= arg max

w02IV
sim(w,w

0
)

in which IV denotes the set of in-vocabulary words, and
the function sim is the cosine similarity between two word
vectors.

sim(w,w

0
) = cos(vec(w), vec(w

0
))

However, since the word vectors and the lexical transla-
tion table are learned automatically from data, they may lead
to inappropriate alternative for original translation pairs. For
example, the most similar word to the rare word ’Ñ>’ (do-
nation) at the end of the following sentence is ’yfl’ (raise),
which is in fact a synonym to the second to last word ’fl∆’.
As a result, this sentence will be ungrammatical after replace-
ment because it will has two neighbouring predicates with the
same meaning.

As another example, the similarity model find a synonym
word ’�å’ to the rare word ’1å’ (discord) in the follow-
ing sentence, but the lexical translation table gives it a wrong
translation ’divorce’.

To alleviate this problem, we propose to use multiple can-
didates provided by the similarity model, and choose one
from them by checking whether it is fit for the bilingual con-
text. Bi-directional ngram language model is adopted here for
this purpose. For an aligned word pair (ci, ej), the score to
replace them with alternative (c0i, ej)0 is calculated as follows,

score = p(c

0
i|ci�1, ci�2) + p(c0i|ci+1, ci+2)+

p(e

0
j |ej�1, ej�2) + p(e0j |ej+1, ej+2)

The method to find the most appropriate alternative pair is
described as follows. First, top N most similar words will be
find for the source rare word. Then each of the source alterna-
tive together with its translation will be added to the candidate
list. Finally, the bi-directional language model is used to rank
these candidates and the best is adopted to replace the original
translation pair.

As an alternative method to rerank the candidate pairs, we
can also jointly consider bilingual word similarity. The sim-
ilarity between the two translation pairs (c0i, e0j) and (ci, ej)
will be calculated as follows,

score =

cos(vec(c

0
i), vec(ci)) + cos(vec(e

0
j), vec(ej))

According to this measurement, only the translation pair
which is similar to the original pair in both source and target
side will be selected.
