Different languages are not perfectly corresponded in word
level. For example, English articles are usually omitted when
translated into Chinese. And the city name New York is just
one word in Chinese. Sometimes the correspondence is even
at phrase or sentence level, such as the translation of idioms.
In this paper, we only handle word pairs with one-to-one map-
ping and rare words aligned to null. According to whether the
source and the target word is rare, there are five cases.

– unk to unk, both the source and target word in the aligned
pair are rare words. In this case we will replace the
source word with a similar in-vocabulary word and the
target word with the translation of the similar word.

– unk to common, only the source word is rare. In this
case we will keep the target word and replace the source

word with the translation of the target word.
– common to unk, only the target word is rare. In this case

we will keep the source word and replace the target word
with the translation of the source word.

– common to common, no replacement in this case.
– unk to null or null to unk, source or target rare word is

not aligned to any word. In this case we simply remove
the rare word from the sentence.
