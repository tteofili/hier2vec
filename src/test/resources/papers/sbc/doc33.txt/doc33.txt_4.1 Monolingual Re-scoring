To evaluate the quality of the translation, the most
simple approach is to check whether the translated
sentences are readable. To achieve this, using lan-
guage model is an effective way to check whether
the sentences fit into the model that trained on a
large corpus. If the language model score is high,
it implies that the sentence holds the high proba-
bility to be generated from the corpus. We trained
a single layer LSTM with 300 hidden state to pre-
dicting the next word. Image caption datasets
MSCOCO and IAPR TC-12 (overall 56,968 sen-
tences) are used as training data.
