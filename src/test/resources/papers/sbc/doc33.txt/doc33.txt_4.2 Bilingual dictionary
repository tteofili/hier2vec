In the WMT 16â€™ multimodal task, captions are
structured with simple grammars; therefore, only
considering language model may be insufficient
to distinguish good translations. In order to di-
rectly consider whether the concepts mentioned in
the source sentences are all well-translated, we uti-
lize the bilingual dictionary Glosbe1, in which we
use the words in one language extracting the corre-
sponding words in the other language. We directly
count the number of words in the source language
that the synonyms in target language are also in
the translated results as the re-ranking score.
