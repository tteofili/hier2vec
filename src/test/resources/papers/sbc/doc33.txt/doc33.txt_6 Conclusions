We enhanced the attention-based neural machine
translation by incorporating information in mul-
tiple modalities. We explored different encoder-
decoder architectures including the LSTM with
multiple sequential global/regional visual and tex-
tual features as states for attention and the parallel
LSTM threads approach. Our best model achieved
2.0% improvement in BLEU score and 2.3% in
METEOR using the visual features of an entire
image and interesting regional objects within. For
re-scoring translation candidates, we investigated
monolingual LSTM language model, bilingual au-
toencoder, and bilingual dictionary re-scoring. We
further achieved an additional 1.1% improvements
in METEOR using a bilingual dictionary. Integra-
tion of more modalities such as audio would be a
challenging but interesting next step.
