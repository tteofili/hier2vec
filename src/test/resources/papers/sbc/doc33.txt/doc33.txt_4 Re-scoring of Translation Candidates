In the neural machine translation, the easiest way
to decode is to greedily get the words with highest
probability step-by-step. To achieve better perfor-
mance, ensemble of models are required. Transla-
tion candidates are generated from multiple mod-
els, and we aim to figure out which candidate
should be the best one. The following we de-
scribe the approaches we investigated to re-score
the translation candidates using monolingual and
bilingual information.
