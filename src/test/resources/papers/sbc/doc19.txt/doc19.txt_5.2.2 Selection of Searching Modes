With the hyper-parameters given by the develop-

ing procedures, cross-lingual similarization is con-
ducted on the whole FBIS dataset. All the searching
mode configurations are tried and 6 pairs of gram-
mars are generated. For each of the 6 Chinese de-
pendency grammars, we also give the three indi-
cators as described before. Table 2 shows that,
cross-lingual similarization results in grammars with
much higher cross-lingual similarity, and the adap-
tive accuracies given by the adapted grammars ap-
proach to those of the original grammars. It indi-
cates that the proposed algorithm improve the cross-

lingual similarity without losing syntactic knowl-
edge.

To determine the best searching mode for tree-
based machine translation, we use the Chinese-
English FBIS dataset as the small-scale bilingual
corpus. A 4-gram language model is trained on
the Xinhua portion of the Gigaword corpus with
the SRILM toolkit (Stolcke and Andreas, 2002).
For the analysis given by non-projective similarized
grammars, The projective transformation should be
conducted in order to produce projective depen-
dency structures for rule extraction and translation
decoding. In details, the projective transformation
first traverses the non-projective dependency struc-
tures just as they are projective, then adjusts the or-
der of the nodes according to the traversed word se-
quences. We take NIST MT Evaluation testing set
2002 (NIST 02) for developing , and use the case-
sensitive BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) to measure
the translation accuracy.

The last column of Table 2 shows the perfor-
mance of the grammars on machine translation. The
cross-lingually similarized grammars correspond-
ing to the configurations with projective searching
for Chinese always improve the translation perfor-
mance, while non-projective grammars always hurt
the performance. It probably can be attributed to
the low performance of non-projective parsing as
well as the inappropriateness of the simple projec-
tive transformation method. In the final application
in machine translation, we adopted the similarized
grammar corresponding to the configuration with
projective searching on the source side and non-
projective searching on the target side.
