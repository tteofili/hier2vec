We propose an automatic cross-lingual similariza-
tion algorithm for dependency grammars, design an
automatic evaluation metric to measure the cross-
lingual similarity between grammars, and use the
similarized grammars to improve dependency tree-
based machine translation. Experiments show the
efficacy of this method. The cross-lingual similar-
ization in this paper is still soft similarization, it is
worth to investigate the hard similarization, where
the syntactic structures are totally isomorphic be-
tween two languages. Of course, in such syntactic
structures, the syntactic nodes should be super-node,
that is, a graph containing one or more basic syntac-
tic nodes. Hard similarization could be more suit-
able for cross-lingual applications, and we leave this
aspect for future research.
