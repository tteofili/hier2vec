The real performance of a cross-lingually similar-
ized grammar is hard to directly measured. The ac-
curacy on the standard testing sets no longer reflects
the actrual accuracy, since cross-lingual similariza-
tion leads to grammars with annotation styles differ-
ent from those of the original treebanks. We adopt
the transfer learning strategy to automatically adapt
the divergence between different annotation styles,
and design a transfer classifier to transform the de-
pendency regularities from one annotation style to
another.

The training procedure of the transfer classifier is
analogous to the training of a normal classifier ex-
cept for the features. The transfer classifier adopts
guiding features where a guiding signal is attached
to the tail of each normal feature. The guiding sig-
nal is the dependency path between the pair of words
in the source annotations, as shown in Figure 2.
Thus, the transfer classifier learns the statistical reg-
ularity of the transformation from the annotations of
the cross-lingually similarized grammar to the an-
notations of the original treebank. Figure 1 shows

Algorithm 1 Cooperative cross-lingual similarization.
1: function BISIMILARIZE(Gα, Gβ , λ, C) . C includes a set of sentence pairs (xα, xβ)
2: repeat
3: Tα,Tβ ← BIANNOTATE(Gα,Gβ, λ,C) . it invokes BIPARSE to parse each (xα, xβ)
4: Gα ← GRAMMARTRAIN(Tα)
5: Gβ ← GRAMMARTRAIN(Tβ)
6: until SIMILARITY(Gα,Gβ) converges . according to formula 2, averaged across C
7: return Gα, Gβ
8: function BIPARSE(Gα, Gβ , λ, xα, xβ , A)
9: yα ← argmaxy(1− λ)Sα(y) + λSβ(y) . according to formula 4

10: yβ ← argmaxy(1− λ)Sβ(y) + λSα(y)
11: return yα, yβ

the training pipeline for the transfer classifier, where
source corpus and target corpus indicate the cross-
lingually similarized treebank and the manually an-
notated treebank, respectively.

In decoding, a sentence is first parsed by
the cross-lingually similarized grammar, and then
parsed by the transfer classifier with the result of
the similarized grammar as guiding signals to obtain
the final parsing results. The improvement achieved
by the transfer classifier against a normal classifier
trained only on the original treebank reflects the
promotion effect of the cross-lingually similarized
grammar. The accuracy of the transfer classifier,
therefore, roughly indicates the real performance of
the cross-lingually similarized grammar.

path(i, j) denotes the dependency path between i and j. In this

example, j is a son of the great-grandfather of i.
