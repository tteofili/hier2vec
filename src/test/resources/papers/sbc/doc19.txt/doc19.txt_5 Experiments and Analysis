We first introduce the dependency parsing itself,
then describe the cross-lingual similarization, and
finally show the application of cross-lingually simi-
larized grammars in tree-based machine translation.
For convenience of description, a grammar trained
by the conventional dependency model is named
as original grammar, a grammar after cross-lingual
similarization is named as similarized grammar, and
the transferred version for a similarized grammar is
named as adapted grammar.
