Abstract

Structural isomorphism between languages
benefits the performance of cross-lingual ap-
plications. We propose an automatic al-
gorithm for cross-lingual similarization of
dependency grammars, which automatically
learns grammars with high cross-lingual sim-
ilarity. The algorithm similarizes the an-
notation styles of the dependency grammars
for two languages in the level of classifica-
tion decisions, and gradually improves the
cross-lingual similarity without losing linguis-
tic knowledge resorting to iterative cross-
lingual cooperative learning. The dependency
grammars given by cross-lingual similariza-
tion have much higher cross-lingual similar-
ity while maintaining non-triviality. As appli-
cations, the cross-lingually similarized gram-
mars significantly improve the performance of
dependency tree-based machine translation.
