We have presented a web-based support system for authoring municipal procedural documents. The prin-
cipal novel feature of the system is that it makes use of document structuring based on the DITA frame-
work, which affords a basis for fine-grained context-dependent CL rules coupled with pre-translation
processing. It consequently enables MT to generate outputs appropriate to their functional context with-
out degrading the quality of the source.

MuTUAL is currently operational online, focusing on the Task topic for creating municipal procedural
documents in Japanese and English. The implemented CL rules were shown to be effective in triggering
more appropriate outputs from our SMT system (Miyata et al., 2015). Also, a preliminary user evaluation
revealed that the controlled authoring assistant module helped reduce time correcting CL-violations by
more than 30%. As a future evaluation plan, while previous work has tended to focus on sentence-
level text quality, we intend to evaluate the document-level quality of the system products by adopting
task-based methods (Colineau et al., 2002). We will eventually make the system available to municipal
departments and assess its usability in actual work scenarios.

4TexTra is a state-of-the-art SMT system particularly intended for Japanese as source language, and provides free API.
