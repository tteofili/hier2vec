The MuTUAL system comprises modules for document structuring, controlled writing, and multilin-
gualisation (see Figure 2). The following modules realise the contextual translation we have outlined:

• Topic template is the core interface for authoring self-contained topics in a structured manner.
The left pane in Figure 3 provides the basic DITA Task topic structure for composing municipal
procedural documents.

• CL authoring assistant analyses each sentence in the text box and highlights any segment that vio-
lates a local CL rule or controlled terminology, together with diagnostic comments and suggestions
for rewriting (shown at bottom centre in Figure 3) (Miyata et al., 2016). In addition, we have imple-
mented a preliminary rewriting support function with several of the features advocated by Mitamura
et al. (2003). For a particular CL-noncompliant segment, the function offers alternative expressions;
clicking one of the suggestions automatically replaces the offending segment in the text box above.

• Pre-translation processing automatically modifies source segments in the background following
transformation rules defined for each functional element, and then MT produces the translation and
back-translation at the same time.

The key mechanism for enhancing authoring and translation is to invoke the CL authoring assistant
tuned to the current functional element. For example, only for the Steps elements of the template, it
implements the rule ‘use declarative form shimasu at the end of the sentence’. Then the pre-translation
processing for Steps transforms the declarative ‘shimasu’ into an imperative ‘shiro’ for our MT system
to produce the desired imperative form ‘do’ on the target side.

The modules above are implemented in PHP and JavaScript, and can be accessed through the usual
web browsers. The topic template seamlessly connects with our SMT system, TexTra,4 the dictionary of
which is customised by municipal terminology we maintain. We plan to publish an open-source version
of the system through our project website.5
