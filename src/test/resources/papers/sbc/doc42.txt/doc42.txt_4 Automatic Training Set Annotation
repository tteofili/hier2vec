Our approach relies on annotating politeness in the
training set to obtain the politeness feature which we
discussed previously. We choose a sentence-level
annotation because a target-side honorific may have
no word-level correspondence in the source. We will
discuss the annotation of German as an example,
but our method could be applied to other languages,
such as Japanese (Nariyama et al., 2005).

German has distinct pronoun forms for informal
and polite address, as shown in Table 1. A further
difference between informal and polite speech are
imperative verbs, and the original imperative forms
are considered informal. The polite alternative is to
use 3rd person plural forms with subject in position
2:

• Ruf mich zurück. (informal)
(Call me back.)

• Rufen Sie mich zurück. (polite)
(Call you me back.)

We automatically annotate politeness on a sen-
tence level with rules based on a morphosyntactic
annotation by ParZu (Sennrich et al., 2013). Sen-
tences containing imperative verbs are labelled in-
formal. Sentences containing an informal or polite
pronoun from Table 1 are labelled with the corre-
sponding class.

Some pronouns are ambiguous. Polite pronouns
are distinguished from (neutral) 3rd person plural
forms by their capitalization, and are ambiguous in
sentence-initial position. In sentence-initial posi-
tion, we consider them polite pronouns if the English
source side contains the pronoun you(r). For Ihr and
ihr, we use the morphological annotation by ParZu
to distinguish between the informal 2nd person plu-
ral nominative, the (neutral) 3rd person singular da-
tive, and the possessive; for possessive pronouns, we

distinguish between polite forms and (neutral) 3rd
person forms by their capitalization.

If a sentence matches rules for both classes, we
label it as informal – we found that our lowest-
precision rule is the annotation of sentence-initial
Sie. All sentences without a match are considered
neutral.
