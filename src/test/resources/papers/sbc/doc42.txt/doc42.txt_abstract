Abstract

Many languages use honorifics to express po-
liteness, social distance, or the relative so-
cial status between the speaker and their ad-
dressee(s). In machine translation from a lan-
guage without honorifics such as English, it
is difficult to predict the appropriate honorific,
but users may want to control the level of po-
liteness in the output. In this paper, we per-
form a pilot study to control honorifics in neu-
ral machine translation (NMT) via side con-
straints, focusing on English→German. We
show that by marking up the (English) source
side of the training data with a feature that en-
codes the use of honorifics on the (German)
target side, we can control the honorifics pro-
duced at test time. Experiments show that
the choice of honorifics has a big impact on
translation quality as measured by BLEU, and
oracle experiments show that substantial im-
provements are possible by constraining the
translation to the desired level of politeness.
