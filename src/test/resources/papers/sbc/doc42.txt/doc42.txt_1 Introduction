Many languages use honorifics to express polite-
ness, social distance, or the relative social status be-
tween the speaker and their addressee(s). A wide-
spread instance is the grammatical T-V distinction
(Brown and Gilman, 1960), distinguishing between
the familiar (Latin Tu) and the polite (Latin Vos)
second person pronoun. In machine translation from
a language without honorifics such as English, it
is difficult to predict the appropriate honorific, but
users may want to control the level of politeness in
the output.

The research presented in this publication was conducted in
cooperation with Samsung Electronics Polska sp. z o.o. - Sam-
sung R&D Institute Poland.

We propose a simple and effective method for in-
cluding target-side T-V annotation in the training of
a neural machine translation (NMT) system, which
allows us to control the level of politeness at test
time through what we call side constraints. It can be
applied for translation between languages where the
T-V distinction is missing from the source, or where
the distribution differs. For instance, both Swedish
and French make the T-V distinction, but reciprocal
use of T pronouns is more widespread in Swedish
than in French (Schüpbach et al., 2006). Hence, the
Swedish form is not a reliable signal for the appro-
priate form in the French translation (or vice-versa).

Our basic approach of using side constraints to
control target-side features that may be missing from
the source, or are unreliable because of a cate-
gory mismatch, is not limited to the T-V distinc-
tion, but could be applied to various linguistic fea-
tures. This includes grammatical features such as
tense and the number/gender of discourse partici-
pants, and more generally, features such as dialect
and register choice.

This paper has the following contributions:

• we describe rules to automatically annotate the
T-V distinction in German text.

• we describe how to use target-side T-V anno-
tation in NMT training to control the level of
politeness at test time via side constraints.

• we perform oracle experiments to demonstrate
the impact of controlling politeness in NMT.
