The results of the NYU-MILA system is presented
in Table 1. The character-level decoding works
well on most of the languages that are tested,
achieving comparable BLEU-c scores to other ap-
proaches using words or subwords (BPE) as to-
kens. Note that our system does not incorporate
extra monolingual training corpus, and does not
include any kind of postprocessing e.g., reranking.

1We used the multi-bleu.perl script from Moses during
training and internal evaluation.
