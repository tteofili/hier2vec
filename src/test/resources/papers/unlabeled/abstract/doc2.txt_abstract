Abstract
Neural Machine Translation (NMT) is an end-to-end learning approach for automated translation,

with the potential to overcome many of the weaknesses of conventional phrase-based translation systems.
Unfortunately, NMT systems are known to be computationally expensive both in training and in translation
inference – sometimes prohibitively so in the case of very large data sets and large models. Several authors
have also charged that NMT systems lack robustness, particularly when input sentences contain rare words.
These issues have hindered NMT’s use in practical deployments and services, where both accuracy and
speed are essential. In this work, we present GNMT, Google’s Neural Machine Translation system, which
attempts to address many of these issues. Our model consists of a deep LSTM network with 8 encoder
and 8 decoder layers using residual connections as well as attention connections from the decoder network
to the encoder. To improve parallelism and therefore decrease training time, our attention mechanism
connects the bottom layer of the decoder to the top layer of the encoder. To accelerate the final translation
speed, we employ low-precision arithmetic during inference computations. To improve handling of rare
words, we divide words into a limited set of common sub-word units (“wordpieces”) for both input and
output. This method provides a good balance between the flexibility of “character”-delimited models and
the efficiency of “word”-delimited models, naturally handles translation of rare words, and ultimately
improves the overall accuracy of the system. Our beam search technique employs a length-normalization
procedure and uses a coverage penalty, which encourages generation of an output sentence that is most
likely to cover all the words in the source sentence. To directly optimize the translation BLEU scores,
we consider refining the models by using reinforcement learning, but we found that the improvement
in the BLEU scores did not reflect in the human evaluation. On the WMT’14 English-to-French and
English-to-German benchmarks, GNMT achieves competitive results to state-of-the-art. Using a human
side-by-side evaluation on a set of isolated simple sentences, it reduces translation errors by an average of
60% compared to Google’s phrase-based production system.
