In this section, we propose a second phrase selec-
tion method based on the results from the syntac-
tic analysis of source language data. This method
first processes all the source language data with a
phrase structure parser, traverses and counts up all
the subtrees of parse trees as shown in Figure 2, and
finally selects phrases corresponding to a subtree in
frequency order.2 We propose this method because
we expect the selected phrases to have syntactically
coherent meaning, potentially making human trans-
lation easier than other methods that do not use syn-
tactic information.
It should be noted that because this method counts

all subtrees, it is capable of selecting overlapping
phrases like the methods based on n-grams. There-
fore we also experiment with a method using to-
gether both subtrees and the semi-maximal phrases
proposed in Section 4.1 to select both syntactic and
non-redundant segments.
