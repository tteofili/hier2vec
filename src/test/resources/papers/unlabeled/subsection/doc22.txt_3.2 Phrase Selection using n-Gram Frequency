In the second baseline approach, we directly select
and translate n-gram phrases that are the most fre-
quent in the source language data but not yet cov-
ered in the translated data (Bloodgood and Callison-
Burch, 2010). This method allows for improvement
of coverage with fewer additional words than sen-
tence selection, achieving higher efficiency by re-
ducing the amount of data unnecessarily annotated.
Bloodgood and Callison-Burch (2010) showed that
by translating the phrases selected by this method
using a crowdsourcing website, it was possible to
achieve a large improvement of BLEU score, out-
performing similar sentence-based methods.

However, as mentioned in the introduction, this
method has several issues. First, because it uses
short phrases, it often selects phrases that are not
linguistically well-formed, potentially making them
difficult to translate concisely. Second, it also has
problems with redundancy, with no device to pre-
vent multiple overlapping phrases being selected
and translated. Finally, the previous work limits the
maximum phrase length to n = 4, precluding the
use of longer phrases. However, using a larger limit
such as n = 5 is not likely to be a fundamental solu-
tion, as it increases the number of potentially over-
lapping phrases, and also computational burden. In
the next section we cover our proposed solutions to
these problems in detail.
