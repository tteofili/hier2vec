Large amounts of resources are available to build
an English/French SMT system in the framework
of the WMT’14 translation task. The bilingual
corpora include Europarl (61M words), news com-
mentary (5.5M), UN (421M), and two crawled
corpora of 90M and 780M words respectively.
The last two corpora are quite noisy. To train
the French language model, about 712M words of
crawled newspaper material is available in addi-
tion to the target side of the bitexts. All the word
counts refer to French words after tokenization.

It is commonly acknowledged that training sta-
tistical models on the concatenation of all this
data does not necessarily lead to optimal per-
formance, and results in extremely large mod-
els which are difficult to handle. Instead, one
should focus on the most relevant subset of the
data for a given task. We have done so by
applying the data selection method proposed in
(Moore and Lewis, 2010), and its extension to bi-
texts (Axelrod et al., 2011). By these means we
selected a subset of 418M words out of more
than 2G words for language modeling and a
subset of 348M out of 850M words for train-
ing the RNN Encoder–Decoder. We used the
test set newstest2012 and 2013 for data
selection and weight tuning with MERT, and
newstest2014 as our test set. Each set has
more than 70 thousand words and a single refer-
ence translation.

For training the neural networks, including the
proposed RNN Encoder–Decoder, we limited the
source and target vocabulary to the most frequent
15,000 words for both English and French. This
covers approximately 93% of the dataset. All the
out-of-vocabulary words were mapped to a special
token ([UNK]).

The baseline phrase-based SMT system was
built using Moses with default settings. This sys-
tem achieves a BLEU score of 30.64 and 33.3 on
the development and test sets, respectively (see Ta-
ble 1).
