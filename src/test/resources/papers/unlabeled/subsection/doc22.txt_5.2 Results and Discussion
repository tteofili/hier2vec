Comparison of efficiency: In Figure 3, we show
the evaluation score results by the number of addi-
tional source words up to 100k and 1M words. We
can see that in English-French translation, the ac-
curacy of the selection methods using parse trees
grows more rapidly than other methods and was sig-
nificantly better even at the point of 1M additional
words. In the case of English-Japanese translation,
the gains over 4-gram frequency are much smaller,
but the proposed methods still consistently perform
as well or better than the other methods. Besides,
in all the graphs we can see the improvement of
reduced-maxsubst-freq and reduced-struct-freq over
maxsubst-freq and struct-freq respectively, demon-
strating that avoiding selecting redundant segments
is helpful in improving efficiency.

Figure 3: BLEU score vs. number of additional source words in each method

Length of selected phrases: Due to the differ-
ent criteria used by each method, there are also sig-
nificant differences in the features of the selected
phrases. In Table 2, we show the details of the
number of all selected phrases, words and average
phrase length until the stop condition, and at the
point of 10k additional source words. Here we see
the tendency that the selection methods based on
parse trees select shorter phrases than other meth-
ods. This is caused by the fact that longer phrases
are only counted if they cover a syntactically defined
phrases, and thus longer substrings that do not form
syntactic phrases are removed from consideration.

Phrase coverage: This difference in the features
of the selected phrases also affects howwell they can
cover new incoming test data. To demonstrate this,
in Table 3 we show the 1-gram and 4-gram cover-
age of the test dataset after 10k, 100k and 1M words
have been selected. From the results, we can see that

the reduced-struct-freq method attains the highest 1-
gram coverage, efficiently covering unknown words.
On the other hand, it is clear that methods selecting
longer phrases have an advantage for 4-gram cover-
age, and we see the highest 4-gram coverage in the
sent-by-4gram-freq method.
