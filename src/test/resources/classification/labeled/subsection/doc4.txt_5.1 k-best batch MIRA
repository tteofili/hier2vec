k-best batchMIRA is a variant of the “hope-fear”MIRA (Chiang et al., 2008) which
uses k-best translations as approximate search spaces, and has been implemented in
the Moses decoder (Cherry and Foster, 2012). In our implementation, in addition to
the “hope-fear” pair (which balance themodel andmetric scores), we provide flexibil-
ity for also including the oracle (metric-best) and anti-oracle (metric-worst), similar to
the hypothesis selection procedure proposed in Eidelman (2012). What is more, since
MIRA is just like stochastic gradient descent (SGD) butwith an adaptive learning rate,
our implementation also allows usingmini-batches for loss gradient estimationwhich
reduces the estimation variance.
