Joshua’s phrase-based decoder is currently a “bare-bones” decoder, lacking state-
of-the-art features such as lexicalized distortion and the operation sequence model
(Durrani et al., 2011). We believe, however, that many of these gains can be imple-
mented using the sparse feature framework (cf. Cherry (2013); Green et al. (2013))
rather than with hard-coded specialized modules.

We also plan to add a lattice decoding feature, which currently only works for the
CKY+-based hierarchical system (where the implementation is simpler).
