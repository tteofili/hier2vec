Our method starts with embedding learning formu-

lations in Collobert et al. (2008). Given a context

window c in a document d, the optimization mini-

mizes the following Context Objective for a word w

in the vocabulary:

J
(c,d)
CO =

∑

wr∈VR

max(0, 1− f(cw, d) + f(cw
r

, d))

(1)

Here f is a function defined by a neural network.

wr is a word chosen in a random subset VR of the

vocabulary, and cw
r

is the context window contain-

ing word wr. This unsupervised objective func-

tion contrasts the score between when the correct

word is placed in context with when a random word

is placed in the same context. We incorporate the

global context information as in Huang et al. (2012),

shown to improve performance of word embed-

dings.
