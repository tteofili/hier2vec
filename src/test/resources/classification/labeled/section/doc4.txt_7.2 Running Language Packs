Language packs are run by executing the script language-pack/run-joshua.sh,
which is meant to be used in the standard unix pipe fashion, taking input on STDIN
andwriting it to STDOUT. It is important that the user take care to pass sentences one
per line, and to normalize and tokenize the input appropriately. This is accomplished
with the prepare.sh script in the language pack. An example invocation is:
cat zh.txt | language-pack/prepare.sh | language-pack/run-joshua.sh > en.txt

Because of the overhead in loading models, language packs can also be run in
server mode:
language-pack/run-joshua.sh -server-port 5867
cat zh.txt | language-pack/prepare.sh | nc localhost 5867 > en.txt
