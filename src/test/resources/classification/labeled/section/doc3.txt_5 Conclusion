In this paper, we introduce bilingual word embed-

dings through initialization and optimization con-

straint using MT alignments The embeddings are

learned through curriculum training on the Chinese

Gigaword corpus. We show good performance on

Chinese semantic similarity with bilingual trained

embeddings. When used to compute semantic simi-

larity of phrase pairs, bilingual embeddings improve

NIST08 end-to-end machine translation results by

just below half a BLEU point. This implies that se-

mantic embeddings are useful features for improv-

ing MT systems. Further, our results offer sugges-

tive evidence that bilingual word embeddings act as

high-quality semantic features and embody bilingual

translation equivalence across languages.
