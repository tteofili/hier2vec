We show results using Word2Vec (Mikolov et al., 2013) to generate word classes
(though it would be just as easy to use Brown clusters (Brown et al., 1992; Liang,
2005) or any other deterministic mapping of words to classes). The word vectors were
trained on the train partitions of each dataset. Results can be found in Table 2. We
experimented with word vectors of various dimensions. Using this language model
in addition to the word-based language model provides a gain of +0.53 BLEU on
the Spanish–English dataset, but no gain on the hierarchical Chinese–English sys-
tem (which may require a greater number of classes or an alternate way of clustering
words into classes).

Table 2. A comparison of phrase-based systems that use class-based language model with
a baseline phrase-based system. Classes are generated by clustering word vectors

obtained by using Word2Vec. We show results for word vectors of dimensions 50, 100,
200 and 300. Class-LMs provide a significant BLEU gain with the Spanish–English system.
