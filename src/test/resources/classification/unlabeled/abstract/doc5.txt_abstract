Abstract

We address the data selection problem in
statistical machine translation (SMT) as a
classification task. The new data selec-
tion method is based on a neural network
classifier. We present a new method de-
scription and empirical results proving that
our data selection method provides better
translation quality, compared to a state-of-
the-art method (i.e., Cross entropy). More-
over, the empirical results reported are co-
herent across different language pairs.
