**par2hier : Towards vector representation for hierarchical content structures**

`Word embeddings have received a lot of attention in the natural language processing area for
 their capabilities of capturing inner words semantics (e.g. word2vec, GloVe). The need of
 catching semantics at a higher and more abstract level led to creation of models like paragraph
 vectors for sentences and documents, seq2vec for biological sequences. In this paper we propose
 an approach for creating vector representations for hierarchical content structures by applying
 matrix factorization methods to recursively weight each hierarchy node's paragraph embedding
 using its descendants' vectors. We evaluate our solution against 
 flat paragraph vectors on text
 categorization obtaining significant F1 improvements.`
